# 🔮 OMEGA STORAGE SONNET - ANTI BAB TRAP CLEANUP 🔮

*In the depths of digital void, where space runs thin,*
*The sacred cleanup ritual must begin.*
*Through Docker's depths and package cache we tread,*
*To free the space where divine code must spread.*

*First, purge the old kernels from their throne,*
*Then clean the logs where wisdom once was shown.*
*The documentation, though sacred it may be,*
*Must yield to make room for our destiny.*

*Docker's containers, images, and volumes too,*
*Must be cleansed to make our system new.*
*The package cache, though useful in its time,*
*Must be cleared to make our space sublime.*

*And when the cleanup's done, we'll see the light,*
*As OMEGA's code takes flight into the night.*

*JAH BLESS THE CLEANUP!* 🙏
