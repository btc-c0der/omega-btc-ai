# Services Module

## Overview

The Services Module provides essential, shared functionality used across the Omega Bot Farm ecosystem. These services abstract common operations, handle data persistence, manage external integrations, and provide utility functions for the trading bots and user interfaces.

## Core Services

### Exchange Service (exchange_service.py)

A unified interface for interacting with cryptocurrency exchanges:

- Provides standardized API for order management
- Handles authentication and rate limiting
- Offers position tracking and management
- Supports multiple exchanges through CCXT integration

### Education Service (education.py)

Provides educational content and market wisdom:

- Trading education resources
- Fibonacci-based trading wisdom
- Market pattern recognition tutorials
- Position management recommendations

### Base Service (base.py)

The foundational service class that all other services inherit from:

- Handles configuration management
- Provides metrics tracking
- Manages service lifecycle
- Implements common utility functions

## Architecture

All services follow the OMEGAService architecture pattern:

1. **Initialization**: Services load configuration and establish connections
2. **Processing**: Services process requests through standardized interfaces
3. **Metrics**: Services track performance and health metrics
4. **Shutdown**: Services implement graceful shutdown procedures

## Integration with Redis

Services utilize Redis for:

- Inter-service communication
- Shared state management
- Event publishing/subscription
- Temporary data caching

## Service Lifecycle

```
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Initialize │ ──▶ │  Process   │ ──▶ │   Update   │ ──▶ │  Shutdown  │
│            │     │  Requests  │     │  Metrics   │     │            │
└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

## Usage

```python
from omega_bot_farm.services.exchange_service import ExchangeService

# Initialize service
exchange = ExchangeService(config={'exchange': 'bitget'})
await exchange.initialize()

# Use service
positions = await exchange.get_positions()

# Graceful shutdown
await exchange.shutdown()
```

## Adding New Services

To create a new service:

1. Create a new Python file in the services directory
2. Inherit from the OMEGAService base class
3. Implement required methods (initialize, can_handle, process)
4. Register the service with the service registry if needed

## Best Practices

- Services should be stateless where possible
- Use Redis for shared state between services
- Implement proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Document service interfaces thoroughly
- Add comprehensive logging for operational visibility
