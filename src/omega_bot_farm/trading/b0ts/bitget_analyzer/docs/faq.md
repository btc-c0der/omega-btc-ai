# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This document answers common questions about the BitGet Position Analyzer Bot.

## General Questions

### What is the BitGet Position Analyzer Bot?

The BitGet Position Analyzer Bot is a trading assistant tool that analyzes your BitGet positions using advanced techniques like Fibonacci analysis and harmony calculations. It helps traders optimize their positions, identify key price levels, and make more informed trading decisions.

### What can I do with the BitGet Position Analyzer Bot?

You can:

- Analyze your current BitGet trading positions
- Identify key Fibonacci retracement and extension levels
- Calculate position harmony and balance
- Set up alerts for price targets and risk levels
- Monitor position changes over time
- Integrate with other trading bots in the Omega Bot Farm ecosystem

### Is this bot making trading decisions or executing trades?

No, the BitGet Position Analyzer Bot is an analytical tool only. It does not make trading decisions or execute trades automatically. It provides analysis to help you make better-informed manual trading decisions.

### Does it work with other exchanges besides BitGet?

Currently, the bot is specifically designed for BitGet's API and account structure. Support for additional exchanges may be added in future releases.

## Setup and Configuration

### What do I need to get started?

You need:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A BitGet account
- API credentials with read permissions for your BitGet account
- Basic familiarity with running Python applications

### How do I set up API credentials?

1. Log into your BitGet account
2. Navigate to API Management
3. Create a new API key (read permissions are sufficient)
4. Store your API key, secret, and passphrase securely
5. Configure the bot with these credentials using environment variables or the configuration file

### Can I run the bot on a VPS or cloud server?

Yes, you can run the bot on any system with Python 3.8+ and internet connectivity to access the BitGet API. It's designed to work well in VPS, cloud, and local environments.

### How much memory and CPU does the bot require?

The bot has minimal resource requirements:

- ~50-100MB of RAM during normal operation
- Low CPU usage (typically less than 5% of a single core)
- Occasional spikes during heavy analysis or when processing many positions

### Can I integrate the bot with Discord or Telegram?

Yes, the bot supports notification integrations with:

- Discord webhooks
- Telegram bots
- Email notifications
- Custom webhooks for other services

## Technical Analysis

### What is Fibonacci analysis?

Fibonacci analysis is a technical analysis method that uses Fibonacci ratios derived from the Fibonacci sequence to identify potential support and resistance levels. The bot calculates these levels based on price movements in your positions to help identify potential price targets and reversal points.

### How does the harmony calculation work?

Harmony calculation evaluates how well-balanced your portfolio of positions is. It considers factors like:

- Ratio of long to short exposure
- Position sizes relative to account balance
- Correlation between different positions
- Risk concentration

A high harmony score indicates a well-balanced portfolio according to the configured parameters.

### How accurate are the analyses?

The accuracy of the analyses depends on market conditions and the quality of your configuration. The bot provides probabilistic tools rather than deterministic predictions. The analyses are most useful when:

1. Used as one component of a broader trading strategy
2. Considered in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis
3. Fine-tuned based on your specific trading approach and risk tolerance

## Troubleshooting

### The bot can't connect to BitGet API. What should I do?

Check these common issues:

1. Verify your API credentials are correct
2. Ensure your IP address is whitelisted in BitGet's API settings
3. Check that BitGet's API services are operational
4. Verify your internet connection and any firewalls
5. Check the troubleshooting guide for more detailed solutions

### Why am I not seeing any positions?

If no positions are displayed:

1. Confirm you have open positions in your BitGet account
2. Verify your API key has read permissions for positions
3. Check if you're using testnet mode incorrectly
4. Ensure you're looking at the correct account type (e.g., USDT futures vs. coin-margined)
5. Try manually refreshing positions with the force_refresh parameter

### Why are my Fibonacci levels different from what I calculate manually?

Differences may occur due to:

1. Different high/low price selections (the bot uses configurable methods to select these prices)
2. Calculation method differences (the bot supports multiple methods)
3. Configuration settings for extended levels
4. Time period differences (the bot analyzes positions over the configured time window)

Adjust the Fibonacci configuration settings to match your preferred calculation approach.

## Performance and Usage

### How often does the bot update position data?

By default, the bot updates position data:

- Every 60 seconds during active monitoring
- When manually requested via the get_positions() method
- Based on your custom polling interval configuration

You can customize the polling interval to suit your trading frequency.

### Will running the bot affect my BitGet account performance?

The bot only reads data from your account and does not perform any trading actions. It uses BitGet's API efficiently with rate limiting to avoid any impact on your account's performance.

### Can I run multiple instances of the bot?

Yes, you can run multiple instances:

- With different configurations for different analysis approaches
- For different BitGet accounts
- For different purposes (e.g., one for analysis, one for notifications)

However, be mindful of API rate limits when running multiple instances with the same API credentials.

## Data and Privacy

### Does the bot store my trading data?

The bot temporarily stores:

- Position data for analysis (in memory)
- Historical position information based on the configured history length
- Analysis results for reporting

Data storage is configurable and can be disabled if you prefer. No data is shared with external services unless you explicitly configure integrations.

### Where are API keys stored?

API keys can be stored in:

- Environment variables (recommended)
- Configuration files (ensure these are secured)
- Passed directly to the bot constructor (for programmatic usage)

The bot never transmits your API credentials to any external service.

## Advanced Usage

### Can I customize the Fibonacci levels?

Yes, you can customize:

- The specific Fibonacci ratios used
- Whether to include extended levels
- The price range selection method
- The time periods analyzed
- The display format of the levels

See the configuration guide for detailed customization options.

### How do I interpret the harmony score?

The harmony score (0-100) indicates how well-balanced your positions are:

- 80-100: Excellent balance according to your parameters
- 60-80: Good balance with minor adjustments recommended
- 40-60: Moderate balance with adjustments recommended
- 0-40: Potential imbalance that might need significant adjustment

The specific recommendations depend on your trading strategy and risk tolerance.

### Can I automate responses to the analysis?

While the bot itself doesn't execute trades, you can:

1. Use the bot's Redis integration to share analysis results with other bots
2. Set up webhooks to trigger external automation
3. Use the bot's Python API in a larger automated trading system
4. Configure alerts and notifications for specific conditions

### How can I contribute to the bot's development?

You can contribute by:

- Reporting bugs on the GitHub repository
