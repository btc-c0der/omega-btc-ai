# Documentation Tests for BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t

This directory contains tests that verify the quality, accuracy, and completeness of the BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t documentation.

## Test Suite Overview

The documentation tests are organized into three main categories:

1. **API Documentation Tests** (`test_api_documentation.py`)
   - Verifies that all public methods are documented
   - Checks that method signatures in documentation match the actual implementation
   - Tests that parameters have proper type hints and descriptions
   - Ensures return values are documented correctly

2. **Example Validation Tests** (`test_example_validation.py`)
   - Validates that code examples in the documentation actually run
   - Verifies that examples produce the expected outputs
   - Checks that API usage examples match the current API
   - Tests advanced usage examples for correctness

3. **Markdown Quality Tests** (`test_markdown_quality.py`)
   - Ensures documentation follows markdown best practices
   - Checks that required sections are present
   - Verifies code examples are properly formatted
   - Validates that headers follow a logical structure
   - Tests for common spelling and grammar issues

## Running the Tests

To run all documentation tests:

```bash
python -m pytest src/omega_bot_farm/trading/b0ts/bitget_analyzer/tests/documentation
```

To run a specific documentation test:

```bash
python -m pytest src/omega_bot_farm/trading/b0ts/bitget_analyzer/tests/documentation/test_api_documentation.py
```

## Documentation Testing Best Practices

These tests enforce the following documentation best practices:

1. **Complete API Documentation**
   - Every public method should be documented
   - Parameters and return values should have types and descriptions
   - Docstrings should match actual method signatures
   - Examples should demonstrate proper API usage

2. **Functional Examples**
   - Code examples should be syntactically correct
   - Examples should run without errors
   - Output comments should match actual outputs
   - Examples should cover basic and advanced usage

3. **Quality Markdown**
   - Documentation should follow a logical structure
   - Headers should maintain proper hierarchy
   - Code blocks should specify language
   - Tables should be well-formatted
   - Links should be valid
   - Images should have alt text

## Verification Scope

| Category | Test Cases | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| API Documentation | 5 | Tests for docstring completeness, signature matching, parameter documentation, return value documentation, and markdown coverage |
| Example Validation | 5 | Tests for example syntax, execution, initialization examples, analysis examples, and harmony score examples |
| Markdown Quality | 8 | Tests for required sections, header structure, code blocks, links, images, tables, spelling/grammar, and API method documentation |

## Handling Missing Documentation

If documentation files are missing, tests will be automatically skipped rather than failing. This ensures that:

1. The test suite can run even without documentation
2. Documentation can be developed in parallel with tests
3. Tests provide guidance on what documentation should include

## Development Workflow

When updating the API or adding new features:

1. Run the documentation tests to identify what documentation needs updating
2. Update the documentation to match the new API
3. Add examples demonstrating the new features
4. Run the tests again to verify the documentation is complete and accurate

This ensures documentation stays in sync with implementation, and examples remain current and functional.
