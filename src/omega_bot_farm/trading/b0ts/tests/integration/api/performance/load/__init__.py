"""
Load tests for the BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t API.

These tests verify that the API can handle sustained load over time, including:
- Consistent performance with a steady request rate
- Stable response times over long-duration tests
- Resource usage patterns under continued load
- Behavior under different load patterns (constant, step, ramp-up)
- Detection of performance degradation over time
