# CCXT Exchange Integration Tests

This directory contains tests for the CCXT exchange integration in Omega Bot Farm.

## Test Structure

The tests are organized using a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach with:

1. **Base Test Classes**: Common test functionality is defined in `test_ccxt_b0t.py` using the `BaseCCXTClientTests` class
2. **Exchange-Specific Tests**: Exchange-specific tests extend the base classes (e.g., in `bitget/test_bitget_ccxt.py`)
3. **Shared Fixtures**: Common fixtures are defined in `conftest.py` and can be used by all test modules

## Running Tests

### Basic Tests (No CCXT Required)

To run the basic tests that don't require CCXT:

```bash
# From the project root directory
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/exchanges/test_ccxt_b0t.py::TestCCXTClientWithoutCCXT -v
```

This will run only the tests that verify:

- The `to_dict` utility function
- Error handling when CCXT is not available
- Initialization behavior without CCXT

### Complete Tests (CCXT Required)

To run all tests, including those that require CCXT:

```bash
# First, install CCXT
pip install ccxt

# Then run the tests
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/exchanges/ -v
```

### Exchange-Specific Tests

To run tests for a specific exchange:

```bash
# For Bitget tests
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/exchanges/bitget/ -v
```

## Base Test Classes

The `BaseCCXTClientTests` class in `test_ccxt_b0t.py` provides the following test classes:

1. `TestUtilityFunctions`: Tests for utility functions that don't require CCXT
2. `TestWithoutCCXT`: Tests that verify behavior when CCXT is not available
3. `TestWithCCXT`: Tests that require CCXT to be installed

## Exchange-Specific Tests

Exchange-specific tests (like those in `bitget/test_bitget_ccxt.py`) extend the base classes, allowing:

1. Reuse of common test functionality
2. Addition of exchange-specific test cases
3. Specialization for specific exchange behavior

When adding a new exchange, you should:

1. Create a new directory for the exchange (e.g., `binance/`)
2. Create a test file that inherits from the base test classes
3. Add exchange-specific test cases and fixtures

## Test Fixtures

Common fixtures are defined in `conftest.py`:

- `mock_ccxt_order`: Mock CCXT order object
- `mock_ccxt_ticker`: Mock CCXT ticker object
- `mock_ccxt_position`: Mock CCXT position object
- `ccxt_client`: Pre-configured CCXT client for testing
- `no_ccxt_client`: Client configured to simulate CCXT not being available
- And more standardized fixtures

## Current Test Coverage

The current test coverage is approximately 70%. We've structured the tests to provide good coverage of:

1. Base CCXT client functionality in `test_ccxt_b0t.py`
2. Exchange-specific behavior in Bitget implementation
3. Error handling when CCXT is not available
4. Core utility functions like `to_dict`

To see the current test coverage:

```bash
pytest --cov src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/exchanges/ -v
```

## Expected Results

### Without CCXT

When running without CCXT installed, you should see:

- Basic utility tests passing
- Tests requiring CCXT displaying appropriate error messages
- Error handling tests passing

### With CCXT

When running with CCXT installed, all 34 tests should pass, including:

1. Core CCXT functionality tests
2. Bitget-specific implementation tests
3. Error handling and utility function tests

## Benefits of the DRY Implementation

Our DRY implementation provides significant benefits:

1. **Code Reuse**: The base test classes in `test_ccxt_b0t.py` are reused by Bitget-specific tests
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to common test logic need to be made in only one place
3. **Consistency**: All exchange implementations follow the same testing pattern
4. **Extensibility**: Adding new exchange implementations is straightforward
5. **Readability**: The test structure clearly shows the relationship between general and specific functionality

## Bitget-Specific Tests

The Bitget-specific tests in `bitget/test_bitget_ccxt.py` demonstrate how to extend the base test classes for a specific exchange. They include:

1. Tests for Bitget's symbol suffix handling
2. Tests for Bitget-specific API endpoints
3. Tests for Bitget's position management

## Future Improvements

While the current test coverage is good at 70%, future improvements could include:

1. More comprehensive tests for WebSocket functionality
2. Additional exchange implementations (Binance, OKX, etc.)
3. Additional tests for rate limiting behavior
4. Stress testing for high-frequency trading scenarios

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter test failures, check:

1. CCXT installation status
2. API key configuration for live tests
3. Network connectivity for exchange API access
4. Pytest configuration in `pytest.ini`
5. Python environment and dependencies
