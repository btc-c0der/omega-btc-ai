# Quantum Security Tests for Omega Bot Farm Trading

This test suite ensures the Omega Bot Farm trading system is protected against quantum computing attacks by verifying the implementation of quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms and protocols, and measuring quantum security metrics.

## Focus Areas

### Quantum-Resistant Cryptography

- Post-Quantum Cryptography implementations
- One-Shot Signatures
- One-Time Tokens
- Integration with Trading Operations

### Quantum Security Metrics

- Hash security metrics (avalanche effect, Grover's algorithm resistance)
- Authentication security metrics (signature schemes, key rotation)
- Validator privacy metrics (anonymization, deanonymization resistance)
- Metrics dashboard generation and visualization

## Test Structure

### Signature and Authentication Tests

- `TestQuantumSignatures`: Tests the generation of keypairs, signing and verification of messages using quantum-resistant algorithms
- `TestOneTimeTokens`: Tests one-time token generation, validation, reuse prevention, and expiration
- `TestQuantumSecurityIntegration`: Tests integration of quantum security features with trading operations

### Metrics Tests

- `TestHashSecurityMetrics`: Tests collection and reporting of hash security metrics
- `TestAuthenticationSecurityMetrics`: Tests collection and reporting of authentication security metrics  
- `TestValidatorPrivacyMetrics`: Tests collection and reporting of validator privacy metrics
- `TestMetricsDashboard`: Tests generation of HTML and Kubernetes dashboards for security metrics
- `TestMetricsCollection`: Tests aggregation of all metric categories

## Supported Signature Schemes

- FALCON
- DILITHIUM
- SPHINCS+
- ONE_SHOT
- ZK_ECDSA

## Common Test Fixtures

The `conftest.py` file provides several fixtures for testing:

- `mock_keypair`: Mock keypair for quantum-resistant signatures
- `mock_token`: Mock one-time token for quantum authentication
- `quantum_auth`: Mock quantum-resistant authentication service
- `quantum_trading_client`: Mock trading client with quantum security integration

## Running the Tests

To run all quantum security tests:

```bash
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/security/ -v
```

To run signature tests only:

```bash
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/security/test_quantum_security.py::TestQuantumSignatures -v
```

To run metrics tests only:

```bash
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/security/test_quantum_metrics.py -v
```

To run a specific test method:

```bash
pytest src/omega_bot_farm/tests/trading/security/test_quantum_security.py::TestQuantumSignatures::test_sign_and_verify_one_shot -v
```

## Security Considerations

- **Key Generation**: Tests verify proper key generation for quantum-resistant algorithms
- **Signature Security**: Tests verify signature validity and resistance to forgery  
- **One-Shot Usage**: Tests ensure one-shot signatures cannot be reused
- **Token Security**: Tests verify token validation and resistance to forgery
- **Expiration**: Tests verify proper handling of expired keys and tokens
- **Integration Security**: Tests verify secure integration with trading operations
- **Metrics Collection**: Tests verify proper measurement of quantum security indicators

## Future Improvements

- HSM (Hardware Security Module) integration testing
- QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator) testing
- Performance testing of quantum-resistant algorithms
- Side-channel attack resistance testing
- Key distribution testing
- Additional metrics for quantum resistance
