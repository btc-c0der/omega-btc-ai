# Core Components Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive test cases for the core components of the Omega Bot Farm trading system.

## Test Files

- `test_base_b0t.py`: Tests for the BaseB0t class
- `test_exchange_client.py`: Tests for the ExchangeClient class
- `test_module.py`: Entry point for running all tests

## Running Tests

You can run the tests in several ways:

### Using the Shell Script

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x run_tests.sh

# Run all tests
./run_tests.sh
```

### Using Python Directly

```bash
# Run all tests
python3 test_module.py

# Run specific test file
python3 test_base_b0t.py
python3 test_exchange_client.py
```

### Using unittest Module

```bash
# From the project root directory
python -m unittest discover src/omega_bot_farm/trading/b0ts/core/tests

# Run specific test file
python -m unittest src/omega_bot_farm/trading/b0ts/core/tests/test_base_b0t.py
python -m unittest src/omega_bot_farm/trading/b0ts/core/tests/test_exchange_client.py
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:

- **BaseB0t**:
  - Initialization
  - Logging
  - State management
  - Environment variable loading
  - Utility methods

- **ExchangeClient**:
  - Initialization
  - Connection methods (with fallbacks)
  - Credential management
  - API request methods
  - Symbol formatting
  - Error handling

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new file named `test_*.py`
2. Import the necessary modules
3. Create a class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`
4. Implement test methods that start with `test_`
5. The tests will be automatically discovered when running `test_module.py`
