# BitGet Position Analyzer Bot

The BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t is a specialized component within the Omega Bot Farm designed to monitor, analyze, and provide insights on BitGet exchange positions using Fibonacci-based mathematical principles.

## Overview

This bot connects to the BitGet exchange API to fetch position data and applies Fibonacci-based analysis to identify optimal entry/exit points, evaluate position harmony, and generate trading recommendations. The analyzer integrates with the Trading Analyzer architecture while adding specialized position monitoring capabilities.

## Key Features

1. **Position Monitoring**: Continuously tracks open positions on BitGet exchange
2. **Fibonacci Analysis**: Applies the golden ratio (Ï† â‰ˆ 1.618) and Fibonacci retracement levels to calculate optimal take profit and stop loss targets
3. **Position Harmony**: Calculates a harmony score based on how well positions align with Fibonacci principles
4. **Change Detection**: Identifies and reports new, closed, or significantly changed positions
5. **Portfolio Recommendations**: Generates actionable recommendations based on position analysis

## Mathematical Foundation

The BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t leverages several key mathematical constants:

- **Golden Ratio (Ï†)**: 1.618034... - A universal constant found throughout nature and markets
- **Inverse Golden Ratio (1/Ï†)**: 0.618034... - Used for retracement calculations
- **Fibonacci Sequence**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... - The ratio of consecutive numbers approaches Ï†
- **Fibonacci Retracement Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6% - Used to identify potential support and resistance

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CCXT library (`pip install ccxt`)
- BitGet API credentials

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install ccxt pyyaml redis

# Set environment variables for API access
export BITGET_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export BITGET_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"
export BITGET_PASSPHRASE="your_passphrase"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.omega_bot_farm.trading.b0ts.bitget_analyzer.bitget_position_analyzer_b0t import BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Initialize the analyzer
    analyzer = BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t()
    
    # Get and analyze all positions
    analysis = await analyzer.analyze_all_positions()
    
    # Print analysis results
    print(f"Total positions: {analysis['total_positions']}")
    print(f"Harmony score: {analysis['harmony_score']:.2f}")
    
    # Print recommendations
    for rec in analysis['recommendations']:
        print(f"- {rec}")

# Run the main function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### Configuration Options

When initializing the BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t, you can configure several parameters:

```python
analyzer = BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t(
    api_key="your_api_key",               # BitGet API key
    api_secret="your_api_secret",         # BitGet API secret
    api_passphrase="your_passphrase",     # BitGet API passphrase
    use_testnet=True,                     # Use testnet instead of mainnet
    position_history_length=10            # Number of position snapshots to keep
)
```

## Position Analysis

The analyzer provides detailed analysis for each position:

### Fibonacci Levels

For each position, the bot calculates Fibonacci-based price levels:

```python
# Example output for a long BTC position with entry at $30,000
{
    "fibonacci_levels": {
        "0.0%": 30000.0,              # Entry price
        "23.6%": 37080.0,             # 23.6% extension
        "38.2%": 41460.0,             # 38.2% extension
        "50.0%": 45000.0,             # 50% extension
        "61.8%": 48540.0,             # Golden ratio (key target)
        "78.6%": 53580.0,             # 78.6% extension
        "100.0%": 60000.0,            # 100% extension (double entry)
        "161.8%": 78540.0,            # 1.618 extension (key target)
        "261.8%": 108540.0            # 2.618 extension (moonshot target)
    }
}
```

### Position Harmony

Each position receives a harmony score (0.0-1.0) based on:

1. **Size Harmony**: How closely the position size aligns with the golden ratio (0.618) of account equity
2. **Leverage Harmony**: Whether the position uses leverage close to Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
3. **PnL Contribution**: Whether the position is profitable

### Recommended Targets

The analyzer identifies the optimal profit targets and stop losses based on Fibonacci principles:

```python
{
    "recommended_take_profit": ("61.8%", 48540.0),  # Golden ratio target
    "recommended_stop_loss": ("38.2%", 18540.0)     # Common reversal level
}
```

## Portfolio Analysis

At the portfolio level, the BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t evaluates:

### Account Statistics

```python
{
    "account_stats": {
        "balance": 10000.0,               # Account balance
        "equity": 10500.0,                # Balance + unrealized PnL
        "total_position_value": 6180.34,  # Total position exposure (golden ratio!)
        "total_pnl": 500.0,               # Total unrealized profit/loss
        "long_exposure": 3819.66,         # Long exposure (inverse golden ratio!)
        "short_exposure": 2360.68,        # Short exposure
        "long_short_ratio": 1.618,        # Long:Short ratio (golden ratio!)
        "exposure_to_equity_ratio": 0.618,# Exposure to equity (inverse golden ratio!)
        "harmony_score": 0.85             # Overall harmony score
    }
}
```

### Portfolio Harmony

The overall harmony score (0.0-1.0) is calculated based on:

1. **Long-Short Balance**: How closely the ratio of long to short exposure approaches the golden ratio (1.618)
2. **Exposure Level**: How closely the total exposure to equity ratio approaches the inverse golden ratio (0.618)
3. **PnL Contribution**: Overall profitability

### Recommendations

The analyzer generates actionable recommendations for portfolio management:

```
- Portfolio has good Fibonacci harmony. Maintain current balance.
- Consider taking profit on BTC/USDT:USDT long position with 8.3% gain.
- Consider adding a small short position to maintain golden ratio balance.
```

## Change Detection

The analyzer tracks position changes between updates:

```python
{
    "changes": {
        "new": [
            # New positions since last check
        ],
        "closed": [
            # Positions that were closed
        ],
        "changed": [
            # Positions with significant changes in size or PnL
        ]
    }
}
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### Redis Integration

The BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t can publish analysis results to Redis for other systems to consume:

```python
# Configure Redis publishing
redis_client = RedisClient(host="localhost", port=6379)
redis_client.publish("position_analysis", json.dumps(analysis))
```

### Discord Notifications

Position changes and significant harmony shifts can trigger Discord notifications:

```python
# Send Discord notification for new position
webhook_url = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..."
discord_notifier.send_position_notification(webhook_url, new_position)
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

The BitgetPositionAnalyzerB0t can be deployed in Kubernetes using the provided configuration:

```bash
# Apply Kubernetes configuration
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployments/bitget-position-analyzer.yaml
```

This creates:

- A deployment running the analyzer
- A service exposing the analyzer API
- A ConfigMap with configuration settings
- A CronJob for generating daily position reports
- A PersistentVolumeClaim for storing reports

## Development and Extending

### Adding New Fibonacci Metrics

To add a new Fibonacci-based metric:

```python
def calculate_fibonacci_wave_count(self, prices: List[float]) -> int:
    """Calculate the Fibonacci wave count from price history."""
    # Implementation here
    return wave_count
```

### Customizing Harmony Calculation

The harmony score calculation can be customized by adjusting the weights:

```python
def _calculate_custom_harmony(self, position: Dict[str, Any], weights: Dict[str, float]) -> float:
    """Calculate custom harmony score with specified weights."""
    harmony = 0.5  # Base harmony
    
    # Apply custom weights to different factors
    # Implementation here
    
    return harmony
```

## Performance Considerations

- **API Rate Limits**: The analyzer respects BitGet API rate limits to avoid throttling
- **Caching**: Position data is cached to reduce API calls
- **Async Processing**: Async methods are used for non-blocking operation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why use Fibonacci levels for analysis?**
A: Fibonacci levels are widely observed in markets as psychological price points where support and resistance often occur. The golden ratio (1.618) appears frequently in nature and trading.

**Q: How can I improve my harmony score?**
A: Adjust position sizes to approach the inverse golden ratio (0.618) of your equity, and maintain a long-to-short exposure ratio close to the golden ratio (1.618).

**Q: Can I use this with other exchanges?**
A: While currently optimized for BitGet, the analyzer can be extended to support other exchanges that have CCXT integration.

## Troubleshooting

**API Connection Issues**

```
{"error": "Exchange client not initialized"}
```

Solution: Verify your API credentials and network connectivity.

**Missing Position Data**

```
"positions": []
```

Solution: Ensure you have open positions on the account and the API key has permission to view them.
