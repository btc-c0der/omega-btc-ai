# üß† Cyberpunk Matrix Tribute to bt3gl

A cyberpunk-themed Matrix rain CLI animation created as a tribute to [Marina Della Torre von Steinkirch (bt3gl)](https://www.bt3gl.xyz/), inspired by her work in cryptography, quantum physics, and blockchain technology.

## üåê Overview

This Python CLI tool creates a Matrix-style digital rain animation with:

- Bitcoin and L2 scaling symbols and messages
- Quantum physics formulas (reflecting bt3gl's PhD in Theoretical Astrophysics)
- References to cryptography and blockchain protocols
- Cyberpunk aesthetics with custom colors and characters

## ‚ö° Features

- **Bitcoin L2 Messaging**: Displays rotating messages about Bitcoin L2 scaling solutions and cryptographic security
- **PhD-Level Physics**: Shows quantum physics equations as a nod to bt3gl's academic background
- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: Matrix-style digital rain with custom characters and colors
- **Bitcoin Symbols**: Integration of Bitcoin and cryptography symbols (‚Çø, ‚ö°, etc.)
- **Terminal Responsive**: Adapts to your terminal size

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omega-btc-ai.git
cd omega-btc-ai

# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x src/omega_bot_farm/matrix_btc_cyberpunk.py
```

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script directly:

```bash
python -m src.omega_bot_farm.matrix_btc_cyberpunk
```

### Command Line Options

```
usage: matrix_btc_cyberpunk.py [-h] [--no-btc] [--no-physics]

Cyberpunk Matrix Rain - Tribute to bt3gl

options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --no-btc       Disable Bitcoin emphasis
  --no-physics   Disable physics formulas
```

### Controls

- Press `q` to quit the animation
- Press `Ctrl+C` to exit

## üé® Customization

You can customize the animation by editing the constants at the top of the script:

- `BTC_SYMBOLS`: Bitcoin and crypto-related symbols
- `CYBERPUNK_CHARS`: Characters used in the digital rain
- `BITCOIN_L2_MESSAGES`: Messages about Bitcoin L2 scaling
- `RESEARCH_KEYWORDS`: References to bt3gl's research interests
- `QUANTUM_PHYSICS_FORMULAS`: Quantum physics equations
