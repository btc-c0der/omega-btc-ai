# CyBer1t4L QA Bot - Docker Setup

The CyBer1t4L QA Bot is an advanced quality assurance system for the OMEGA Trading Ecosystem. It monitors test coverage, performs real-time QA, and maintains the sacred harmony of the codebase.

## ðŸ§¬ Features

- Comprehensive test coverage analysis
- Real-time monitoring of critical systems
- Automated test generation for low-coverage code
- Discord integration for QA reporting
- Kubernetes-ready deployment

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A Discord server where you have admin privileges
- Discord bot credentials (Application ID, Public Key, and Bot Token)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omega-btc-ai.git
cd omega-btc-ai
```

2. **Configure environment variables**

Create a `.env` file in the project root or ensure these variables are in your environment:

```
CYBER1T4L_APP_ID=your_application_id
CYBER1T4L_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token
```

3. **Build and run with Docker Compose**

```bash
cd src/omega_bot_farm/docker/cyber1t4l-qa-bot
docker-compose up -d
```

## ðŸ¤– Adding the Bot to Discord

1. Use the following URL template to add the bot to your Discord server:

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&permissions=274878221376&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

2. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your `CYBER1T4L_APP_ID` value
3. Open the URL in your browser
4. Select your Discord server and click "Authorize"
5. Complete any verification steps

The permissions included are:

- Read messages/view channels
- Send messages
- Embed links
- Attach files
- Use slash commands
- Use application commands

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REDIS_HOST` | Redis server hostname | `redis` |
| `REDIS_PORT` | Redis server port | `6379` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `INFO` |
| `CYBER1T4L_APP_ID` | Discord application ID | (required) |
| `CYBER1T4L_PUBLIC_KEY` | Discord public key | (required) |
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Discord bot token | (required) |
| `COVERAGE_THRESHOLD` | Minimum acceptable test coverage | `80.0` |
| `TESTING_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | How often to run tests | `60` |

## ðŸ“Š Bot Commands

When added to your Discord server, CyBer1t4L supports the following commands:

- `/coverage` - Get the current test coverage report
- `/test [module]` - Run tests for a specific module
- `/monitor` - Start real-time monitoring
- `/qa_status` - Get the overall QA status of the codebase

## ðŸ”„ Kubernetes Deployment

The CyBer1t4L QA Bot is designed to run in a Kubernetes cluster. To deploy it:

1. Ensure your Kubernetes cluster is up and running
2. Apply the Kubernetes configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f src/omega_bot_farm/kubernetes/deployments/cyber1t4l-qa-bot.yaml
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Considerations

- The bot requires Discord credentials which should be kept secure
- The credentials are stored in Kubernetes secrets in the cluster
- For local development, use `.env` files which are not committed to the repository
- The bot requires read access to the codebase to perform coverage analysis

## ðŸ“š Documentation

For more information on how the CyBer1t4L QA Bot works, see:

- [API Documentation](../../API.md)
- [Architecture Documentation](../../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Installation Guide](../../INSTALLATION.md)

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the Docker image locally:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t omega-btc-ai/cyber1t4l-qa-bot:latest -f Dockerfile ../../..

# Run with required environment variables
docker run -it --rm \
  -e CYBER1T4L_APP_ID=your_app_id \
  -e CYBER1T4L_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key \
  -e DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token \
  omega-btc-ai/cyber1t4l-qa-bot:latest
```
