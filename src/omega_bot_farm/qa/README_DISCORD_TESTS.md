# Discord Interaction Testing Suite for CyBer1t4L Bot

This document covers the Discord interaction testing suite for CyBer1t4L QA Bot, which allows comprehensive testing of Discord.py's interaction endpoints used by the bot.

## Overview

The testing suite provides a way to verify that all Discord interaction methods used by the CyBer1t4L bot work correctly. It tests the following interaction endpoints:

1. `interaction.response.send_message()` - Direct message responses
2. `interaction.response.defer()` - Deferred responses with followup
3. `interaction.edit_original_response()` - Editing initial responses
4. `interaction.response.is_done()` - Checking if a response is complete
5. `interaction.original_response()` - Retrieving the original response
6. Error handling during interactions

## Testing Options

There are two ways to test the Discord interaction endpoints:

### 1. Live Testing with Discord API

Using the `test_discord_interactions.py` script, you can test interactions with the actual Discord API. This requires a bot token and proper Discord application setup.

### 2. Offline Mock Testing

Using the `test_discord_interactions_mock.py` script, you can test interactions without a Discord connection. This is useful for development and CI/CD environments where Discord access may not be available.

## Installation Requirements

Ensure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install discord.py python-dotenv
```

For mock testing, only the standard library is required.

## Configuration

### Live Testing Configuration

The live test suite uses the same environment variables as the main bot:

- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Discord bot token
- `CYBER1T4L_APP_ID` - Your bot's application ID

These can be set in your `.env` file or passed directly as command-line arguments.

### Mock Testing Configuration

No configuration is required for mock testing, as it simulates the Discord API entirely offline.

## Running the Tests

### Running Live Tests

To run the interaction tests against the live Discord API:

```bash
python src/omega_bot_farm/qa/test_discord_interactions.py
```

Or with explicit token:

```bash
python src/omega_bot_farm/qa/test_discord_interactions.py --token YOUR_TOKEN --app-id YOUR_APP_ID
```

### Running Mock Tests

To run mocked interaction tests without connecting to Discord:

```bash
python src/omega_bot_farm/qa/test_discord_interactions_mock.py
```

The mock tests will generate a `discord_interaction_test_results.md` file with the detailed results.

## Live Test Commands

When running live tests, the following slash commands will be available in your Discord server:

- `/test_interactions response_send_message` - Tests direct message responses
- `/test_interactions response_defer` - Tests deferred responses
- `/test_interactions response_edit` - Tests editing original responses
- `/test_interactions response_is_done` - Tests checking response completion status
- `/test_interactions error_handling` - Tests error handling during interactions
- `/test_interactions original_response` - Tests retrieving original responses
- `/test_interactions_report` - Generates a report of all test results

## Test Reports

### Live Testing Reports

After running the live tests, use the `/test_interactions_report` command to get a summary of test results. This will show which tests passed and which failed, including error details for failures.

### Mock Testing Reports

The mock tests automatically generate a Markdown report file with comprehensive test results, which can be examined to validate interaction behavior.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with live testing:

1. **Command sync issues**: Ensure your bot has the correct permissions, including the `applications.commands` scope.
2. **Response failures**: Check that your bot has proper permissions in the channel.
3. **Interaction timeouts**: Discord interactions must be acknowledged within 3 seconds. If you're seeing timeouts, check that your code is responding promptly.
4. **Privileged intent issues**: Verify that the "Message Content Intent" is enabled in the Discord Developer Portal.

## Mapping to Discord.py Interaction API

Here's how our tests map to the official Discord.py Interaction API:

| Test Command | API Method | Description |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| `response_send_message` | `interaction.response.send_message()` | Sends an immediate response to an interaction |
| `response_defer` | `interaction.response.defer()` | Defers the response, allowing for longer processing time |
| `response_edit` | `interaction.edit_original_response()` | Edits the original interaction response |
| `response_is_done` | `interaction.response.is_done()` | Checks if the interaction has been responded to |
| `original_response` | `interaction.original_response()` | Fetches the original interaction response |

## Example Test Output

### Live Test Output

```
# Discord Interactions Test Report

âœ… response_send_message: success
âœ… response_defer: success
âœ… response_edit: success
âœ… response_is_done: success
âœ… error_handling: success
âœ… original_response: success
```

### Mock Test Output

Mock tests produce a more detailed report, including each test's execution status and notes about how each interaction endpoint is used in the CyBer1t4L bot.

## CI/CD Integration

For automated testing in CI/CD environments, it's recommended to use the mock tests as they don't require Discord credentials or network connectivity. You can add the following to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Test Discord Interactions
  run: python src/omega_bot_farm/qa/test_discord_interactions_mock.py
  
- name: Verify Test Results
  run: |
    if ! grep -q "Success Rate: 6/6" discord_interaction_test_results.md; then
      echo "Not all Discord interaction tests passed!"
      exit 1
    fi
```
