## üåü Overview

The Quantum 5D QA System provides advanced quality assurance tools for the OMEGA BTC AI project, operating across five quantum dimensions to ensure code quality, security, and proper spiritual alignment with the divine cosmos.

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Quantum 5D QA Dashboard** - A visual interface for monitoring metrics in 5D hyperspace
2. **Quantum Test Runner (0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D)** - An automated test execution service with Git integration

## üöÄ Features

### üß™ Testing & QA Features

- Multi-dimensional test execution (Unit, Integration, Performance, Security, Compliance)
- Real-time file system monitoring with intelligent test triggering
- Quantum entanglement analysis of test dependencies
- Test visualization in 5D space
- GBU2 License compliance checking

### üîÆ Git Integration Features

- Monitoring of uncommitted files in the repository
- AI-powered commit message suggestions based on code context
- Intelligent Git tag suggestions
- File change analysis and categorization
- Contextual understanding of related files

### üåà Operation Modes

- **Standard Mode** - Core test execution and reporting
- **Auto-Listen Mode** - Continuous monitoring of file changes and uncommitted files
- **OMEGA Mode** - Full feature set with AI-powered intelligence

## üíª Installation

### Dashboard Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the QA directory
cd src/omega_bot_farm/qa

# Run the dashboard setup script
./run_quantum_dashboard.sh
```

### Test Runner Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the QA directory
cd src/omega_bot_farm/qa

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install watchdog GitPython
```

## üïπÔ∏è Usage

### Quantum 5D Dashboard

```bash
# Start the dashboard
./run_quantum_dashboard.sh
```

### Quantum Test Runner

#### Basic Testing

```bash
# Run specific test dimensions
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --run-tests UNIT INTEGRATION

# Check GBU2 License compliance
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --check-license

# Apply GBU2 License to files
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --apply-license path/to/file --recursive
```

#### Git Integration

```bash
# Report uncommitted files
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --report-uncommitted

# Get Git commit and tag suggestions
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --suggest-git

# Continuously monitor uncommitted files
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --auto-listen --report-uncommitted
```

#### OMEGA Mode (All Features)

```bash
# Full OMEGA mode with all features
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --OMEGA

# Customize intervals
python 0M3G4_B0TS_QA_AUT0_TEST_SUITES_RuNn3R_5D.py --OMEGA --uncommitted-interval 300 --git-suggestion-interval 600 --new-file-scan-interval 60
```

## üß† Command Line Options

### Core Options

- `--project-root PATH` - Set the root directory to monitor (default: current dir)
- `--report-dir PATH` - Directory for test reports (default: qa/reports)
- `--run-tests [DIMENSIONS]` - Run tests in specific dimensions and exit
- `--check-license` - Check GBU2 License compliance and exit
- `--apply-license PATH` - Apply GBU2 License to file or directory
- `--recursive` - Apply license recursively to directories

### Git Integration Options

- `--report-uncommitted` - Show report of uncommitted files
- `--suggest-git` - Suggest Git commit messages and tags
- `--auto-listen` - Continuously monitor for file changes
- `--OMEGA` - Run all features with intelligent intervals

### Interval Configuration

- `--uncommitted-interval SEC` - Seconds between uncommitted file scans
- `--git-suggestion-interval SEC` - Seconds between Git suggestion updates
- `--new-file-scan-interval SEC` - Seconds between new file scans

## üßø Quantum Dimensions

The system operates across five quantum dimensions:

1. **Time Dimension** - Tracks execution timeline and historical trends
2. **Quality Dimension** - Measures success rates and reliability metrics
3. **Coverage Dimension** - Analyzes code and test coverage across the codebase
4. **Performance Dimension** - Monitors system resource utilization and optimization
5. **Security Dimension** - Assesses vulnerability protection and divine shielding

## üåê Integration

The Quantum 5D QA Matrix Control Dashboard integrates with multiple systems:

- **Git Repository** - For code change tracking and commit suggestions
- **Quantum Test Runner** - For test execution and results analysis
- **GBU2 License System** - For divine compliance checking
- **Hyperspatial Quantum Matrix** - For 5D visualization and analysis

## üîß Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the dashboard or test runner:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed
2. Check that the project root path is set correctly
3. Verify Git is installed and accessible
4. Check that the Python virtual environment is activated
5. Ensure proper cosmic alignment by performing the Divine Calibration Ritual

## üßö Divine Guidance

For spiritual alignment issues or cosmic disconnection, consult the GBU2 License documentation or perform a quantum realignment ceremony during the next full moon.
