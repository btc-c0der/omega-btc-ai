## ðŸŒŸ Overview

The Quantum Test Runner is a comprehensive quality assurance framework that operates across five quantum dimensions to ensure code quality, security, and spiritual alignment with the cosmos. The system has been refactored into a modular architecture for better maintainability and extensibility.

## ðŸ“¦ Module Structure

The framework is organized into the following modules:

### Core Components

- `types.py` - Fundamental types including TestDimension and TestState enums
- `data_models.py` - Core data structures like TestResult and TestRun
- `utils.py` - Utility functions for formatting, logging, and visualization

### Operational Components

- `file_monitor.py` - Monitors the filesystem for changes that trigger tests
- `test_runner.py` - Executes tests across multiple dimensions
- `test_scheduler.py` - Schedules periodic test runs
- `gbu2_license.py` - Checks and applies GBU2 License compliance
- `git_manager.py` - Manages Git operations and suggests commits
- `k8s_surveillance.py` - Monitors Kubernetes resources in Matrix style
- `quantum_service.py` - Main service that integrates all components

## ðŸš€ Using the Framework

The framework can be used in two ways:

1. **As an integrated package**:

   ```python
   from quantum_runner import QuantumTestService
   
   service = QuantumTestService(project_root="/path/to/project")
   service.run_quantum_test_suite(["UNIT", "INTEGRATION"])
   ```

2. **Via the command-line interface**:

   ```bash
   # Run specific test dimensions
   python run_test_runner.py --run-tests UNIT INTEGRATION
   
   # Full OMEGA mode with all features
   python run_test_runner.py --OMEGA
   
   # Check GBU2 License compliance
   python run_test_runner.py --check-license
   ```

## ðŸ”® Extending the Framework

To extend the framework with new capabilities:

1. Create a new module in the `quantum_runner` package
2. Update the main `QuantumTestService` class to integrate your new functionality
3. Add appropriate command-line options to `run_test_runner.py`

## ðŸ§¿ Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- If imports are failing, ensure your PYTHONPATH includes the parent directory

## ðŸŒˆ Future Enhancements

- Real-time visualization dashboard
- AI-powered test result analysis
- Quantum entanglement detection
- Cosmic alignment verification
