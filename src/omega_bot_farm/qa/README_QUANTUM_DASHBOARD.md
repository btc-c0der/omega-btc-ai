A high-dimensional quality assurance visualization dashboard that displays 5D quantum metrics for advanced QA monitoring. This dashboard integrates data from multiple sources and presents it in an interactive UI with dimensional analysis capabilities.

## üåå Features

- **5D Visualization**: View test metrics across quantum dimensions
- **Realtime Monitoring**: See QA parameters update in realtime
- **Dimensional Collapse Detection**: Identify potential issues before they occur
- **Quantum Entanglement Analysis**: Understand how metrics affect each other
- **Hyperspatial Trend Visualization**: Detect patterns across dimensions with predictive capabilities

## üìä Visualization Types

- **5D Hypercube**: Navigate all five dimensions in a hypercube projection
- **3D Projection**: View the three primary dimensions with intuitive navigation
- **2D Matrix**: Analyze quality and coverage in a detailed heatmap
- **Quantum Flow**: See the flow of metrics through dimensional space
- **Entanglement Web**: Visualize the connections between different dimensions

## üß† Quantum Dimensions

The dashboard tracks five key dimensions:

- **Quality**: Test success rate and API reliability
- **Coverage**: Code and test coverage metrics
- **Performance**: System resource utilization
- **Security**: Vulnerability assessment and security metrics
- **Time**: Historical trends and temporal analysis

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the installation script:

```bash
./run_quantum_dashboard.sh
```

This will:

- Create a virtual environment if none exists
- Install all required dependencies
- Start the dashboard server

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation:

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements_quantum_dashboard.txt

# Run the dashboard
python quantum_qa_dashboard.py
```

## üîÆ Advanced Usage

### Custom Metrics Collection

The dashboard is designed to integrate with the QA metrics collection system. You can customize metrics collection by modifying the `collect_metrics` method in the `Quantum5DDashboard` class.

### Adding New Visualizations

Extend the dashboard with custom visualizations by adding new methods to the `Quantum5DDashboard` class and updating the visualization callbacks.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Notes

- The dashboard runs on port 8050 by default
- For production use, enable authentication and use HTTPS
- Configure firewall rules to restrict access to the dashboard port

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check Python version compatibility
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure the PYTHONPATH includes the project root
4. Check console logs for specific error messages

## üß™ Integration with CyBer1t4L QA Bot

This dashboard is designed to work with the CyBer1t4L QA Bot ecosystem and connects to its metrics collection system. The collected data is analyzed across five quantum dimensions to provide comprehensive insights into the quality of your system.
