## 🌈 When MATRIX meets REGGAE to vanquish TECH DEBT 🌈

The T3CH D3BT V001D3R is an advanced system that monitors your codebase in real-time, detecting and reporting technical debt with Matrix-style cyberpunk visuals and reggae-inspired harmonious vibes.

This system transcends traditional code analysis by combining:

- 🧠 Quantum pattern recognition for debt detection
- 🌊 Divine flow state analysis
- 🎵 Reggae harmony visualization
- 🖥️ Matrix activation interfaces
- 🔮 Discord integration for team consciousness

## 📋 Features

- **Real-time Tech Debt Detection**: Continuously monitors your code for debt patterns as they emerge
- **Matrix Vision Display**: Stunning cyberpunk visualization of your codebase's health
- **Reggae Harmony Metrics**: Measures your code's flow and rhythm
- **Discord Integration**: Reports directly to your team's Discord server
- **Divine Flow Analysis**: Calculates the cosmic impact of your technical decisions
- **Auto-Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations for restoring harmony to your code

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository (if needed)
cd src/omega_bot_farm/qa/tech_debt_bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (or create .env file)
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_token_here" # Optional for Discord integration
export TECH_DEBT_APP_ID="your_app_id_here" # Optional for Discord integration
```

### Running

```bash
# Run with full features (watching + Discord bot)
python tech_debt_v001d3r.py -d

# Run standalone with file watching only
python tech_debt_v001d3r.py

# Run a single scan without watching
python tech_debt_v001d3r.py -s

# Run with custom project path
python tech_debt_v001d3r.py -p /path/to/your/project
```

## 🎮 Discord Commands

The T3CH D3BT V001D3R integrates with Discord to provide team-wide debt monitoring:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/scan` | Scan the entire codebase for tech debt |
| `/report` | Generate a comprehensive tech debt report |
| `/set_report_channel` | Set the current channel for tech debt alerts |
| `/scan_file [file_path]` | Scan a specific file for tech debt |
| `/top_issues` | Show the most severe tech debt issues |
| `/v001d3r_help` | Display help for all commands |

## 🖥️ CLI Commands

When running the CLI version, you can use these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `scan` | Run a tech debt scan |
| `report` | Generate a tech debt report |
| `matrix` | Toggle matrix display mode |
| `exit` / `quit` / `q` | Exit the program |
| `help` | Show available commands |

## 🔮 Tech Debt Detection Patterns

The V001D3R analyzes your code for these debt patterns:

- TODO/FIXME comments
- Magic numbers
- Nested if statements
- Long functions
- Commented code blocks
- Hardcoded credentials
- Print debugging statements
- Bare except clauses
- Redundant code patterns
- Deep nesting

Each issue is assigned a severity score from 1-10 and suggestions for improvement.

## 🧬 Divine Flow Metrics

Your codebase is analyzed using our proprietary divine flow metrics:

- **Tech Debt Score** (0-100): Overall debt burden
- **Matrix Activation Level** (0-100): Complexity and connectedness
- **Reggae Harmony Level** (0-100): Code rhythm and flow

Based on these scores, your codebase will be assigned a vibe:

- DIVINE FLOW (0-20): Perfect harmony
- RASTAFARIAN RHYTHM (21-40): Minor disruptions
- MATRIX RIPPLES (41-60): Moderate issues
- DIGITAL TURBULENCE (61-80): Significant problems
- CYBER CHAOS (81-100): Critical debt situation

## 🌐 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
- Discord bot token (optional)
- Discord application ID (optional)
