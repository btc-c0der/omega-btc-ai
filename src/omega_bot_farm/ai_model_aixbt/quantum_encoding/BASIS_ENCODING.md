# Basis Encoding Implementation Guide

## Overview

Basis encoding is a quantum encoding technique that maps classical data to the computational basis states of a quantum system. Unlike amplitude encoding, which distributes information across the amplitudes of a quantum state, basis encoding assigns each classical data point to a specific basis state.

## Theoretical Foundation

In an n-qubit quantum system, we have 2^n computational basis states, typically denoted as |0⟩, |1⟩, |2⟩, ..., |2^n-1⟩ in decimal representation, or |000...0⟩, |000...1⟩, etc. in binary representation.

Basis encoding maps discrete classical values to these computational basis states. For instance, if we have a discrete variable with k possible values (where k ≤ 2^n), we can map each value to a distinct basis state.

## Applications in Market Data

Basis encoding is particularly well-suited for:

1. **Categorical features**: Market states (bull/bear/neutral), trading signals (buy/sell/hold), etc.
2. **Discretized continuous variables**: Price levels, volume zones, or volatility regimes that have been binned
3. **Multi-class classification**: Trading strategies with discrete action spaces
4. **Quantum feature selection**: Using superposition of basis states to represent combinations of features

## Implementation Strategy

The `BasisEncoder` should implement:

- Mapping classical categorical or discretized values to basis state indices
- Conversion between one-hot encoding and basis state encoding
- Support for encoding multiple categorical features into different qubit subspaces
- Methods for quantum superposition of basis states (for probabilistic interpretations)

### Key Methods

```python
class BasisEncoder(BaseQuantumEncoder):
    def __init__(self, n_qubits=4, mapping=None, name="basis_encoder"):
        """
        Initialize basis encoder with optional custom mapping.
        
        Args:
            n_qubits: Number of qubits (supports 2^n basis states)
            mapping: Optional dictionary mapping values to basis states
            name: Encoder name
        """
        super().__init__(n_qubits=n_qubits, name=name)
        self.mapping = mapping or {}
    
    def encode(self, data):
        """
        Encode classical data to basis states.
        For categorical data, returns one-hot encoded vectors
        or superposition states if probabilistic=True.
        """
        # Implementation here
    
    def decode(self, quantum_data):
        """
        Decode from basis encoding back to classical values.
        For probabilistic states, returns most likely category
        or probability distribution if return_probs=True.
        """
        # Implementation here
    
    def encode_multiple_features(self, data_dict):
        """
        Encode multiple categorical features into separate
        qubit subspaces.
        """
        # Implementation here
```

## Usage Examples

```python
# Example 1: Encode market regimes
regimes = ['bull', 'bear', 'sideways', 'volatile']
encoder = BasisEncoder(n_qubits=2)  # 2 qubits support 4 states
encoded = encoder.encode(regimes[0])  # Encodes 'bull' as |00⟩ or [1,0,0,0]

# Example 2: Multiple features
market_state = {
    'trend': 'bullish',        # Uses qubit 0
    'volatility': 'high',      # Uses qubit 1
    'volume': 'increasing'     # Uses qubit 2
}
encoder = BasisEncoder(n_qubits=3)
encoded = encoder.encode_multiple_features(market_state)
```

## Benefits for Quantum Algorithms

Basis encoding enables:

1. **Quantum feature maps**: Through superposition and interference of basis states
2. **Quantum classification**: Natural representation for discrete labels
3. **Quantum associative memory**: Storage and retrieval of market patterns
4. **Quantum walks**: For analyzing market state transitions

## Future Extensions

1. **Hybrid encoding**: Combining basis encoding with amplitude or angle encoding
2. **Adaptive basis**: Adjusting the mapping based on data distribution
3. **Hierarchical basis encoding**: Using qubit subspaces for feature hierarchies
4. **QRAM integration**: Efficient loading of basis-encoded features from quantum memory

## Performance Considerations

Basis encoding is particularly efficient for:

- Sparse feature spaces
- Categorical data with many classes
- Systems that benefit from direct access to computational basis states

It tends to be less efficient for:

- High-dimensional continuous data
- Capturing complex correlations between continuous variables

## Implementation Timeline

1. Core `BasisEncoder` class implementation
2. Support for multiple categorical features
3. Probabilistic extensions for superposition states
4. Integration with quantum circuit simulation
5. Advanced mappings (Gray coding, locality-preserving mappings)
