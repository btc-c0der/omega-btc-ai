# AIXBT Quantum Donation Integration

## Overview

The AIXBT Quantum Donation Integration system enables automatic allocation of 80% of AIXBT project revenue to the Omega NGO. This system combines our quantum-inspired prediction technology with automated donation management to create a transparent, verifiable charitable giving framework.

> "Financial innovation should uplift humanity." - AIXBT Project Commitment

## Features

- **Automatic Donation Allocation**: 80% of all AIXBT revenue is automatically allocated to Omega NGO
- **Multi-Signature Verification**: Requires signatures from both AIXBT team and NGO representatives
- **Transparent Smart Contract**: Uses blockchain technology to ensure transparent fund distribution
- **Performance-Based Scaling**: Adjusts donation amounts based on prediction confidence
- **Impact Assessment**: Tracks and reports the real-world impact of donations
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Maintains verifiable records of all donation transactions

## Components

### Donation Manager

Handles core donation processing:

- Donation calculation based on revenue
- Multi-signature verification
- Transaction recording and tracking
- Impact assessment

### Smart Contract Integration

Provides blockchain-based verification:

- Automatic fund distribution
- On-chain verification
- Transaction transparency

### Quantum Donation Bridge

Connects our quantum prediction technology with donation processing:

- Integration with quantum divergence predictor
- Performance-based donation scaling
- Complete end-to-end workflow

## Running the Demo

To run a demonstration of the quantum donation integration:

```bash
# From project root
python -m src.omega_bot_farm.ai_model_aixbt.run_donation_demo
```

This will:

1. Run a quantum prediction simulation
2. Calculate donation amount (80% of revenue)
3. Process the donation through multi-sig verification
4. Execute the donation transaction
5. Generate an impact assessment report

## Configuration

The system can be configured through `config/quantum_donation_config.json`:

```json
{
  "donation_percentage": 0.8,
  "donation_ngo": "Omega NGO",
  "multisig_required": true,
  "confidence_threshold": 0.7,
  "min_donation_amount": 10.0,
  "performance_scaling": true,
  "project_wallet": "0x...",
  "donation_wallet": "0x..."
}
```

## Implementation Details

The donation integration is implemented as a series of Python modules:

- `donation_integration.py`: Core donation management functionality
- `quantum_donation_bridge.py`: Integration with quantum prediction
- `run_donation_demo.py`: Demonstration runner

For more detailed information, see `DONATION_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Commitment to Philanthropy

By integrating donation functionality directly into our quantum prediction system, we ensure that 80% of all project proceeds automatically support the vital work of Omega NGO. This isn't an afterthought - philanthropy is coded into the very foundation of our project.
