# OMEGA BTC AI React Dashboard

This is the React version of the OMEGA BTC AI Dashboard, a modern interface for Bitcoin analytics and insights.

## Development Status

This project is currently in early development. The React-based version of the dashboard is being built to replace the original HTML/JS implementation.

## External APIs

### Crypto Fear & Greed Index

This dashboard integrates with the [Crypto Fear & Greed Index API](https://rapidapi.com/onshabogdan-5SUvbWmtd0l/api/crypto-fear-greed-index2) from RapidAPI to display real-time market sentiment data.

For setup instructions, see [API-SETUP.md](./API-SETUP.md).

## Setup Instructions

There are two ways to run this project locally:

### Method 1: Using a static HTTP server (simplest)

If you're experiencing issues with Vite or other dependencies, you can use this simple approach:

```bash
# Install http-server if you don't have it
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server from the project directory
http-server -p 3000 .
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.

### Method 2: Using Vite (for development)

This method is preferable for active development as it provides hot module reloading and other developer features:

```bash
# Install dependencies with legacy peer deps to handle version conflicts
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

If you encounter issues with Vite, try these steps:

1. Remove node_modules and package-lock.json:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Clean npm cache:

   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. Reinstall with legacy peer deps:

   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```

4. Try running with npx explicitly:

   ```bash
   npx vite
   ```

## Dependency Issues

This project currently has some dependency conflicts between:

- @react-three/drei (requires @react-three/fiber ^9.0.0)
- @react-three/fiber (current version 8.18.0)

These are handled using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag during installation.

## Coming Features
