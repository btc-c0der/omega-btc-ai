# ðŸ”± NGINX Configuration Issues and Fixes

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Issue: Incorrect WebSocket Health Endpoints in NGINX

The NGINX configuration was pointing to incorrect WebSocket health endpoints:

```nginx
# Original incorrect configuration
location /websocket-health/ {
    proxy_pass http://matrix-news-websocket:10095/health/;
    # ...
}

location /ws/health {
    proxy_pass http://matrix-news-websocket:10095/health;
    # ...
}
```

**Fix**: Updated the NGINX configuration to point to the correct WebSocket server port (10091):

```nginx
# Fixed configuration
location /websocket-health/ {
    proxy_pass http://matrix-news-websocket:10091/health;
    # ...
}

location /ws/health {
    proxy_pass http://matrix-news-websocket:10091/health;
    # ...
}
```

### 2. Issue: Incorrect Health Check in Restart Script

The restart script was checking health on incorrect ports and had too rigid matching criteria:

**Fix**:

- Updated health check to use port 10091 instead of 10095
- Added retry logic to account for startup delays
- Made response validation more flexible with simple "status" check instead of specific status values

### 3. Issue: No Proper Diagnostics

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive health scanner that:

- Checks all common ports
- Tests all possible health endpoints
- Shows detailed container status

## Lessons Learned

1. **Multi-Container Communication**: When using Docker, ensure that container names and ports are correctly referenced in proxy configurations.

2. **Health Check Robustness**: Implement retry logic with delays in health checks to account for container startup times.

3. **Proper Diagnostics**: Having a dedicated diagnostic script helps quickly identify configuration issues.

4. **Path Consistency**: Ensure trailing slashes and exact path matches are consistent across all configurations.

## Verified Working Endpoints

The following endpoints are now working correctly:

- Direct WebSocket health: `http://localhost:10091/health`
- WebSocket API health: `http://localhost:10091/ws/health`
- NGINX proxy to WebSocket health: `http://localhost:10083/ws/health`
- NGINX proxy to WebSocket service health: `http://localhost:10083/websocket-health/`
- NGINX proxy to consciousness service health: `http://localhost:10083/service-health/`

## Future Recommendations

1. Add these health endpoints to monitoring systems
2. Consider implementing centralized health status aggregation
3. Add additional metrics to health endpoints (memory usage, uptime, etc.)
4. Implement automated health checks in CI/CD pipelines
