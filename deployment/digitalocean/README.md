# OMEGA BTC AI - BTC Live Feed v2 Digital Ocean Deployment

This guide outlines the deployment process for the BTC Live Feed v2 service on Digital Ocean's App Platform.

## Deployment Requirements

- Digital Ocean account with App Platform access
- Access to the GitHub repository (btc-c0der/omega-btc-ai)
- Redis Cloud instance with TLS enabled

## Deployment Files

The following files are used in the deployment process:

- `app.yaml`: Digital Ocean App Platform configuration
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `runtime.txt`: Python version specification
- `Procfile`: Process type definitions
- `certificates/SSL_redis-btc-omega-redis.pem`: Redis TLS certificate

## Deployment Process

1. Ensure all configuration files are in place:
   - Check `app.yaml` for proper environment variables
   - Verify Redis connection details are correct
   - Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured

2. Deploy using the Digital Ocean CLI:

   ```bash
   doctl apps create --spec deployment/digitalocean/app.yaml
   ```

3. Monitor the deployment:

   ```bash
   doctl apps list
   ```

4. Get deployment details:

   ```bash
   doctl apps get [APP_ID]
   ```

5. View logs:

   ```bash
   doctl apps logs [APP_ID]
   ```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables must be configured:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| REDIS_HOST | Redis server hostname | redis-12345.example.redislabs.com |
| REDIS_PORT | Redis server port | 12345 |
| REDIS_USERNAME | Redis username | omega |
| REDIS_PASSWORD | Redis password | your_password |
| REDIS_SSL | Enable SSL | true |
| REDIS_USE_TLS | Use TLS | true |
| REDIS_CERT | Certificate file name | SSL_redis-btc-omega-redis.pem |
| REDIS_SSL_CERT_REQS | Certificate validation | required |
| REDIS_SSL_CERT_PATH | Path to certificate | /app/deployment/digitalocean/certificates/SSL_redis-btc-omega-redis.pem |
| REDIS_SOCKET_TIMEOUT | Socket timeout in seconds | 5 |
| REDIS_SOCKET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT | Connection timeout in seconds | 5 |
| LOG_LEVEL | Logging level | info |
| DEBUG | Enable debug mode | false |

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Check the build log for dependency issues. You may need to update the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Runtime Errors**: Review app logs for more details about runtime errors.
- **Redis Connection Issues**: Verify the Redis environment variables and certificate path.
- **Health Check Failures**: The application exposes a health check endpoint at `/health`. Verify it's responding correctly.

## Monitoring

The application exposes a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns:

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "redis_connected": true,
  "websocket_connected": true,
  "last_price_update": "2025-03-27T19:30:15.123456Z",
  "uptime": 3600.5,
  "details": {
    "last_price": 65432.10,
    "seconds_since_update": 5.2,
    "uptime_seconds": 3600.5
  }
}
```

## Updating the Application

1. Make changes to your code in the repository
2. Push changes to the `feature/btc-live-feed-v2-cloud` branch
3. Digital Ocean will automatically rebuild and deploy the application

## Rollback

To roll back to a previous deployment:

```bash
doctl apps list-deployments [APP_ID]
doctl apps create-deployment [APP_ID] --force-rebuild
```

## Security Notes

- Ensure Redis credentials are kept secure
- Validate that the TLS certificate is properly configured
- Check that websocket connections are using secure protocols
- Set appropriate rate limits and timeouts to prevent DoS attacks
