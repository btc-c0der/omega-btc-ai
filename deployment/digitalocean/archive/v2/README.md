## Why These Files Were Archived

These files were archived to:

1. Prevent accidental use of v2 alongside v3
2. Maintain historical reference

4. Keep the codebase clean and focused on v3

## Key Differences from v3

v3 introduced several improvements over v2:

- Automatic Redis failover
- Health monitoring

- Improved security features

## How to Restore (If Needed)
