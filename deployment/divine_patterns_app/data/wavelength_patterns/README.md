# Wavelength Patterns Data Directory

This directory stores the divine patterns analysis results and visualizations. The files include:

- `divine_pattern_analysis_*.json`: Analysis results in JSON format
- `divine_patterns_*_time_series.png`: Time series visualizations with pattern markers
- `divine_patterns_*_cosmic_wheel.png`: Polar visualizations of detected divine patterns

These files are generated when the API is used with the `save_results=true` and `visualize=true` parameters.

Files in this directory are not committed to git (except this README) but will be created during runtime and are available in the deployed application.
