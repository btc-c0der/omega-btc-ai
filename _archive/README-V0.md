# OMEGA BTC AI: Market Maker Detection & Bitcoin Price Prediction

## Overview
**OMEGA BTC AI** is a powerful system that predicts **Bitcoin (BTC) prices** based on **Schumann Resonance** data and detects **Market Maker (MM) traps**. The system uses **machine learning** to analyze the correlation between Schumann frequencies and BTC market movements, providing real-time insights and alerts.

## Features
- **Schumann Resonance Data Analysis** üìä
- **BTC Price Prediction** üîÆ
- **Market Maker Detection** üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
- **Interactive Dashboard** üñ•Ô∏è
- **Time-based Filtering for Historical Data** ‚è≥

## Requirements
1. Python 3.8+
2. Virtual Environment (recommended)
3. Required Python libraries:
    - `pandas`
    - `scikit-learn`
    - `plotly`
    - `dash`
    - `talib` (for technical analysis)
    - `requests`
    - `selenium` (for Schumann data scraping)
    - `TA-Lib` (for technical indicators)
    - `pickle`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/omega-btc-ai.git
cd omega-btc-ai
```

### 2. Setup Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys & Data Sources
- **Binance API:** Obtain an API key from Binance for fetching BTC price data. (Optional for testing)
- **Schumann Data Source:** The system uses Schumann Resonance data from the HeartMath Institute or other APIs (can be configured in `fetch_schumann.py`).

### 5. Download Historical Data (Optional but Recommended)
Before training the model, fetch historical BTC and Schumann data:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_btc.py  # Fetches historical BTC data from Binance
python scripts/fetch_schumann.py  # Fetches Schumann Resonance data from HeartMath API
```

---

## Running the Model

### 1. Train the AI Model

Run the following command to train the model:

```bash
python scripts/omega_ai.py  # Trains and saves the model in 'data/omega_model.pkl'
```

This will:
- Train a machine learning model on BTC price data and Schumann Resonance features.
- Save the trained model as `omega_model.pkl` for future use.

### 2. Test the Model & View Feature Importance

Run the feature importance test to see which features are driving the BTC price prediction:

```bash
python scripts/feature_importance_test.py
```

This will output the **importance of each feature** used in the model.

### 3. Run Predictions

Run the following command to predict BTC prices for future Schumann Resonance values:

```bash
python scripts/predict.py  # Predict BTC price for a given Schumann frequency (e.g., 8.2 Hz)
```

This will display the **predicted BTC price** based on Schumann values.

---

## Run the Interactive Dashboard

### 1. Start the Dashboard Server

```bash
python scripts/dashboard.py  # Starts the live interactive dashboard
```

This will:
- Launch a web server with an interactive **Dashboard**.
- You can view BTC prices, Schumann Resonance, and real-time MM alerts.

### 2. Filter by Time Range

Use the **Date Picker** to select a custom **time range** and view historical BTC data and predictions for that range.

---

## Additional Notes

- The system allows you to analyze the correlation between **Schumann Resonance** and **BTC prices** in real-time.
- It also detects **Market Maker traps** by analyzing **fake pumps and dumps**.
- The **predictions** are based on a **Linear Regression model** using features like **Schumann Resonance**, **BTC lag values**, and **BTC price change**.
- Further improvements can include adding **more advanced models (e.g., LSTM)** for predictions and integrating **additional financial indicators**.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any errors related to missing files or dependencies, ensure that:
  - **API keys** for Binance and HeartMath are properly set.
  - Required libraries are installed.
  - Historical data files exist in the `data/` folder.

For any other issues, please check the logs or reach out to the project maintainers.
