## Notes

These endpoints are used in the CyBer1t4L bot for the following purposes:

1. **send_message**: Used in all slash commands to provide immediate responses
2. **defer**: Used in longer-running commands like `/coverage` and `/test`
3. **is_done**: Used in error handling to check if a response has already been sent
4. **edit_original_response**: Used to update responses with new information
5. **original_response**: Used to retrieve and reference previously sent responses
