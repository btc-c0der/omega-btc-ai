A 5% to 10% annualized premium usually indicates neutral markets, reflecting the cost of opportunity and the exchanges&rsquo; risk. However, ETH futures dropped below this threshold on March 8, following a 24% price correction in the prior two weeks.</p><p>The current 2% ETH futures annualized premium suggests a lack of demand for leveraged longs (buys), but this measure is highly influenced by recent price movements. For example, on Oct. 10, 2024, the ETH futures premium dropped to 2.6% after a 14% price correction in two weeks, but the indicator rose to 7% as ETH regained most of its losses. Essentially, the futures premium rarely signals changes in the spot price trend.</p><h2><strong>ETH whales are afraid Ether price will fall further&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>To determine if whales have lost interest in Ether, it is crucial to observe how the market is pricing put (sell) options compared to call (buy) options. When traders anticipate a downtrend, the 25% delta skew metric rises above 6%, indicating a higher demand for hedging strategies.

Source: Laevitas.ch</em></p></figcaption></figure><p>Currently, at 7%, the ETH options&rsquo; 25% delta skew suggests a lack of conviction among professional traders, raising the likelihood of further bearish momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>From a <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-spot-vs-derivatives-trading"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">derivatives market</a> perspective, there is little indication that the recent ETH price correction has bottomed out. Essentially, investors are not confident that the $1,800 support will hold.</p><p>Some analysts argue that the sharp decline in Ethereum network activity is the primary reason for the reduced appeal of ETH, while others suggest that the shift toward layer-2 scalability has significantly diminished the potential of base chain fees. Given the need to compensate <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-ethereum-staking-dominance-risks-overcentralization-execs"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">network validators</a>, the lack of capital inflow requires more ETH issuance, which negatively affects net returns from native staking.</p><h2><strong>The Ethereum network faces steep competition</strong></h2><p>Attempting to pinpoint the reasons behind sellers' motivations is futile, especially when considering Ethereum&rsquo;s competition, which has expanded from blockchains like BNB Chain and Solana to networks tailored for specific challenges. Examples include <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/traders-targeting-hyperliquid-whales-significant-positions-trigger-liquidations-10x-research"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Hyperliquid</a>, focused on synthetic assets and perpetual trading, and Berachain, which is apparently better suited for staked assets in cross-liquidity pools.</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/timeline-jelly-token-exploit-hyperliquid"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""><em><strong>Timeline: Jelly token goes sour after $6M exploit on Hyperliquid</strong></em></a></p><p>The success of certain decentralized applications (DApps) could serve as the final blow to Ether. For example, Ethena, the synthetic dollar protocol on Ethereum, is transitioning to its own layer-1 blockchain. The project, currently holding $5.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/usde-stablecoin-issuer-ethena-raise-100-million-new-token"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">raised $100 million</a> in December 2024 to support this shift.</p><p>However, it may be premature to claim that ETH price will continue to fall, as a major protocol update is only weeks away. Investors should carefully track the practical benefits of Ethereum&rsquo;s Pectra upgrade, particularly in terms of base layer fees and overall usability for the average user. Until then, the chances of ETH outperforming the broader altcoin market remain slim.</p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $76,606 and $80,000.</p><p>The bulls will have to push and maintain the price above the resistance line to signal that the correction may be ending. A close above the 50-day simple moving average ($89,346) could propel the pair to $95,000 and eventually to the psychological resistance at $100,000.</p><h2>Ether price analysis</h2><p>Ether (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">ETH</a>) turned down from the breakdown level of $2,111 and broke below the 20-day EMA ($2,032), indicating that the bears remain in control.</p><figure><img alt=""Price analysis 3/28: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TON, LINK, AVAX"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-03/0195dda4-4ba2-7a4e-b441-23137d02eaf5"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><p><em>ETH/USDT daily chart.

Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the zone because a break below it could resume the downtrend. The next stop on the downside could be $1,550.</p><p>Buyers will have to push and sustain the price above $2,111 to signal that the bearish momentum is weakening. The 50-day SMA ($2,293) may act as a hurdle on the upside, but if taken out, the pair could rally to $2,550.</p><h2>XRP price analysis</h2><p>XRP (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/xrp-price-index"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">XRP</a>) turned down and broke below the moving averages on March 26, indicating that the bears remain sellers on every minor rise.</p><figure><img alt=""Price analysis 3/28: BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, TON, LINK, AVAX"" src=""https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2025-03/0195dda4-56d2-7bf3-ac0a-521244442c2f"" title="""" /><figcaption style=""text-align: center;""><p><em>XRP/USDT daily chart.

This implies that for capital to flow back into BTC, investors&rsquo; mindset must shift from focusing on less risky assets, such as bonds, to riskier assets like BTC or low-quality banks in the Russell index. The researcher said,&nbsp;</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Broadly speaking right now, the macro liquidity backdrop is neutral. Rates have come down marginally, but the carry trade continues to create risk for assets.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>On the contrary, other analysts have pointed out that the rise of the Global M2 money supply could potentially trigger a BTC rally.

Despite this remarkable ascendancy, the unfortunate truth is that this technology has yet to realize its true business potential. A core challenge persists: Too much sensitive data remains publicly unshielded.</p><p>The crux of the issue is that companies must keep business data confidential, and people strive to safeguard their personal information as best they can. Once data is put on a public blockchain, however, it becomes irreversibly and indefinitely exposed.</p><p>Even if a business takes every possible precaution to conceal data, mistakes made by others or vulnerabilities in the system can expose sensitive onchain data or metadata, including participants&rsquo; identities. This can lead to privacy breaches, compliance violations or both, undermining the foundational assumption that blockchain is trusted and underscoring the importance of robust measures to protect sensitive data.</p><p>On the other side of that coin, concealing activity on a blockchain can open the door to money laundering, triggering negative government responses. Instances in which this has occurred have led to a false impression that governments oppose Web3 privacy, a criterion businesses fundamentally need for them to adopt the technology.&nbsp;</p><p>From whichever angle we look at it, maintaining privacy onchain is a real and complex issue for Web3. Until we solve it, businesses will not and should not be expected to cross the chasm.&nbsp;</p><h2>The belief that governments oppose privacy on the blockchain is wrong</h2><p>Web3 entrepreneurs have grown to fear that building decentralized applications and businesses that provide financial anonymity could land them in regulatory trouble. Just look at Samourai Wallet, whose<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/samourai-wallet-shutdown-implications-for-other-privacy-self-custody-tools"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> co-founders were charged with money laundering</a>, or Tornado Cash, whose developer was<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/tornado-cash-verdict-crypto-industry"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> sentenced to 64 months in prison</a> for similar reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>These responses have led to a consensus that governments are opposed to privacy altogether when it comes to blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p><em><strong>Recent: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-and-blockchain-redefine-digital-economy"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-and-blockchain-redefine-digital-economy""><em><strong>AI agents and blockchain are redefining the digital economy</strong></em></a></p><p>This couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth. Governments don&rsquo;t oppose privacy but mandate it across industries. Data protection laws, like the General Data Protection Regulation or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, are in place to ensure businesses protect our customer data from misuse and security threats.</p><p>The real issue these high-profile cases reveal is that Web3 measures to protect data have created opportunities for misuse, enabling the facilitation of criminal activities that have understandably raised serious concerns on behalf of governments. Blockchain data protection capabilities should not undermine established cross-jurisdictional laws safeguarding the global community from terrorism, human trafficking, fraud and other criminal offenses.&nbsp;</p><p>This begs the question: What does privacy, done right, look like?</p><h2>Selective disclosure</h2><p>When it comes to using blockchain, protecting sensitive data is typically accomplished by either keeping the data offchain, or encrypting data onchain. The latter is not durable privacy given quantum computing&rsquo;s rapid advances in cracking encryption.&nbsp;</p><p>The advent of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology, a complex cryptographic technique, allows users to ensure sensitive data remains offchain by sharing attestations about the validity of the data instead. In Web3, ZK has emerged as a transformative way to enhance privacy as it enables untrusted parties to validate that a transaction has occurred without sharing any information about the transaction.&nbsp;</p><p>Decentralized applications can exercise selective disclosure by choosing between putting data onchain (full disclosure), putting it onchain with encryption (disclosure via viewing keys) or using ZK to only publish attestation about the data (offering utility without any disclosure). Selective data disclosure only solves half of the puzzle. It was not designed to account for metadata.</p><h2>The next privacy frontier</h2><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-metadata-in-blockchain-transactions"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">Metadata</a>, the information surrounding our data, is an under-discussed component of blockchain&rsquo;s exposure of sensitive information; it can be used to make inferences, creating an added layer of vulnerability even when the data itself is concealed.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, through transaction metadata, investment and trading strategies can be inferred in addition to other behavioral patterns. For businesses, the implications of this can be detrimental to their growth and ability to stay ahead of competitors. They can&rsquo;t afford to have trade secrets and strategies, or even the identities of other parties they are transacting with, made public.</p><p>The need to protect metadata and remove the ability to make inferences is paramount to security and can be addressed using a private token. Such capability can, however, be easily misused for money laundering.</p><p>If using a private token is not the solution, and using a public token does not provide sufficient levels of confidentiality, then the way to solve this challenge is to rethink Web3&rsquo;s approach to protecting metadata altogether. We need to combine the benefits of both approaches, effectively creating a<a href=""https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-dual-token-model-two-token-economy"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null""> dual-asset system</a> in which a public and a private token are used. Each asset functions independently, meaning specific restrictions can be placed to prevent illicit activities such as money laundering while retaining all the benefits.</p><h2>A powerful framework</h2><p>The dual-asset system enables confidentiality without the ailments shielding metadata usually brings, making compliance and business policy enforcement possible. By combining this tokenomics structure with selective disclosure, privacy and regulatory compliance can coexist on the blockchain, which will have resounding effects on adoption and innovation.</p><p><em><strong>Opinion by: Eran Barak, CEO at Midnight.</strong></em></p><p class=""post-content__disclaimer"" type="""">This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

More and more Australians are discovering the cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle, with ownership rising from 23% in 2023 to 32.5% in 2025, an impressive 41.3% increase. Because there are several platforms to choose from, buying Bitcoin is low-threshold and secure.&nbsp;</p><p>This article covers several methods and describes the steps to safely start investing in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Bitcoin legal in Australia?</h2><p>Yes, Bitcoin is legal in Australia, but it&rsquo;s not considered a legal tender. The local government considers owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>) as property. Any profit you might make from Bitcoin is subject to capital gains tax (CGT), with Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) ensuring AML and CTF compliance.</p><p>Of course, there are also <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/an-overview-of-the-cryptocurrency-regulations-in-australia"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">various regulatory requirements to abide by</a>. AUSTRAC requires cryptocurrency companies to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism-financing (CTF) regulations. This framework aims to protect Australian investors by safeguarding the crypto market against financial crime.</p><p>A significant update in 2025 requires major crypto platforms to obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) for enhanced consumer protection, as <a href=""https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/p2025-628504-s.pdf"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">outlined</a> in government proposals.</p><p><em><strong>Did you know? </strong></em><em>Some Australian exchanges offer instant verification, allowing you to start trading Bitcoin within minutes.</em></p><h2>Prerequisites to buying Bitcoin in Australia</h2><p>Before buying Bitcoin in Australia, it is essential to prepare properly. To get you started, here are some points of interest:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><strong>Understand the legal landscape:</strong> Bitcoin is legal and regulated in Australia by AUSTRAC, but it is not a legal tender. You can safely deal with cryptocurrencies because the government minimizes risks such as money laundering.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Platforms to buy Bitcoin in Australia:</strong> If you want to buy Bitcoin or other crypto assets in Australia, use a reliable platform. Choose CoinSpot, Swyftx or Binance. These exchanges comply with local regulations, allowing you to trade safely. Of course, don&rsquo;t forget to <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-kyc-and-why-do-crypto-exchanges-require-it"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">complete your KYC verification</a>.

This allows you to keep control of your private keys. If you go for long-term storage of your coins, always choose a cold wallet that stores your assets offline.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Payment methods and fees:</strong> The fastest and safest way is to initiate transactions with a reliable payment method, such as bank transfer, credit card or PayID. Always check the associated transaction fees so you don&rsquo;t incur unexpected (sometimes high) fees.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure your investment:</strong> Take precautions for your security, too. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on your accounts and back up private keys regularly.

Here&rsquo;s how you can buy Bitcoin on P2P platforms:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1: Create an account.</strong> Sign up and complete the KYC verification. Have your ID ready and verify your contact details during the process. Notably, Binance P2P, registered with AUSTRAC, ensures compliance with AML/CTF regulations, making it a reliable choice for Australians.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2: Search for Bitcoin offers.</strong> Browse available offers, filtering by payment method (e.g., bank transfer, PayID), price or seller reputation. Prioritize sellers with high feedback scores (e.g., 95%+ positive ratings) and a history of 100+ completed trades for trustworthiness. Binance P2P displays these metrics clearly. As of 2025, Binance P2P supports over 31 fiat currencies and 700+ payment methods globally, tailoring offers to Australian users.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3: Start a trade</strong>. Select the amount of Bitcoin or fiat currency you want to trade and click &ldquo;Buy.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4: Make the Payment</strong>. Pay via bank transfer, PayID or another accepted payment method. The platform holds the Bitcoin in escrow until the payment is confirmed. Notably, PayID transactions are instant and free on Binance P2P, while bank transfers may take 1-2 hours. Confirm receipt with the seller via the platform&rsquo;s messaging system to avoid delays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5: Receive your Bitcoin: </strong>Once the seller verifies your payment, the escrowed Bitcoin is released to your P2P wallet (e.g., Binance wallet). This typically happens within minutes for instant methods like PayID.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p>For maximum security, you could immediately transfer your BTC to a non-custodial wallet like Trust Wallet or a hardware wallet like Ledger. P2P platforms aren&rsquo;t designed for long-term storage.&nbsp;</p><p>This P2P process offers a direct, flexible way to buy Bitcoin, with Binance P2P standing out in 2025 for its robust escrow system and wide payment options. Always double-check seller credibility and avoid off-platform payments to mitigate risks, aligning with best practices for P2P trading.</p><h2>How to buy Bitcoin in Australia using Bitcoin ATMs</h2><p><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/bitcoin-atms-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-teller-machines"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">By using a Bitcoin ATM</a>, you can buy Bitcoin quickly and easily.

According to a <a href=""https://x.com/arkham/status/1905003328464883896"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">postmortem</a> by Arkham Intelligence, this is how it went down:</p><ul><li><p>The exploiter deposited $7 million on three separate Hyperliquid accounts, making leveraged trades on the illiquid Jelly token.</p></li><li><p>Two accounts took $2.15 million and $1.9 million long positions on JELLY, while the other took a $4.1 million short position to cancel the others out.</p></li><li><p>As the price of JELLYJELLY increased, the short position was liquidated, but it was too large to be liquidated normally.</p></li><li><p>The short position was passed to the Hyperliquidity Provider Vault (HLP).</p></li><li><p>The exploiter meanwhile had a seven-figure <a href=""https://intercom.help/walbi/en/articles/8569636-understanding-profit-and-loss-pnl-in-crypto-a-beginner-s-guide"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">PnL</a> from which to withdraw.

According to Arkham, the exchange closed the market with Jelly at $0.0095, the price at which the third account had entered its short trades.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyperliquid announced on X that it would delist perpetual futures trading for the JELLY token, citing &ldquo;evidence of suspicious market activity.&rdquo;</p><p><em><strong>Related: </strong></em><a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/long-and-short-positions-explained"" rel="""" target=""_self"" title=""https://cointelegraph.com/explained/long-and-short-positions-explained""><em><strong>Long and short positions in crypto, explained</strong></em></a></p><p>The exchange said, &ldquo;All users apart from flagged addresses will be made whole from the Hyper Foundation.

The CEO of Bitget, Gracy Chen, wrote, &ldquo;The way it handled the $JELLY incident was immature, unethical, and unprofessional, triggering user losses and casting serious doubts over its integrity.&rdquo;</p><p>She said that the exchange &ldquo;may be on track to become FTX 2.0&rdquo; and that the decision to close the Jelly market and settle positions at a favorable price &ldquo;sets a dangerous precedent.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Alvin Kan, chief operating officer at Bitget Wallet, told Cointelegraph that the Jelly meltdown was just another example of how capricious hype-based price action can be.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;The JELLY incident is a clear reminder that hype without fundamentals doesn&rsquo;t last [...] In DeFi, momentum can drive short-term attention, but it doesn&rsquo;t build sustainable platforms,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The market will continue to expose projects that are built on speculation, not utility, he concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>Arthur Hayes, the founder of BitMEX, seemed to imply that reactions to the Jelly incident were overblown, writing on X, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised.

<p dir=""ltr""><em><strong>Update</strong>: the CTO of TradingView <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/twitter-user-withdraws-his-accusations-claims-tradingviews-fibonacci-tool-is-not-broken"">told</a> Cointelegraph in comments that the reports of a bug were inaccurate, and the Twitter user partially withdrew his earlier claims that the tool was broken.</em></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Popular chart analysis service TradingView reportedly contains a bug in the Fibonacci retracement <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/tags/price-analysis"">technical analysis</a> tool, according to a tweet by self-proclaimed certified Elliott wave analyst Cryptoteddybear <a href=""https://twitter.com/cryptoteddyb/status/1139128519009677313"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">published</a> on June 13.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/articles/technical/111401.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elliott wave</a> principle is a type of technical analysis for predicting prices in financial markets by looking at recurring patterns.</p>
<p>In a video that he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq43S6A_WTc&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">uploaded</a> to YouTube, the analyst explains that the tool does linear calculations when in logarithmic charts, which he notes is a significant issue for Elliot wave traders. The official Twitter account of the company behind the charting service answered his tweet, <a href=""https://twitter.com/tradingview/status/1139587829992951808"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">announcing</a> that the issue is being investigated, to which Cryptoteddybear answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thank you<a href=""https://twitter.com/tradingview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> @tradingview</a> for finally taking this issue seriously.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>The first reports of the bug, posted over five years ago (in November 2014) on consumer community platform getsatisfaction, have been reportedly ignored by the company. Another report submitted on the same platform, dated June 3, 2017, has seen the official TradingView account answer in the thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hi, you are right, we have a planned task to fix this. Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>However, the problem apparently has not yet been solved.
