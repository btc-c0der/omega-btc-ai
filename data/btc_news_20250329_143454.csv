After being pulled from the edge of bankruptcy in 2021 thanks to a surging stock price, the company has made sensible business decisions over the years, such as shrinking its physical footprint and focusing on higher-margin items.&nbsp;<p>Now, GameStop is trying to secure its survival by investing in Bitcoin (<a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">BTC</a>). This approach seems to have worked for Strategy, Michael Saylor&rsquo;s business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin bank. Strategy has now <a href=""https://cointelegraph.com/news/microstrategy-surpasses-500k-bitcoin-holdings-sec-filing"" rel=""null"" target=""null"" title=""null"">amassed more than 500,000 BTC</a> through successive purchases.

There&rsquo;s reason to believe that the video game retailer could make a big splash, given its corporate cash balance of nearly $4.8 billion. This is a notable jump from one year earlier when the company&rsquo;s balance sheet was around $922 million.&nbsp;</p><p>There&rsquo;s also reason to believe that GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen was orange-pilled by Michael Saylor after the two met in early February.
