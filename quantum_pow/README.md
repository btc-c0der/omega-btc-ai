- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Ready-to-use Kubernetes manifests for deploying a mining cluster
- **CSRF Protection**: Advanced monitoring system to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks
- **Validator Privacy**: Metadata protection for validator nodes to prevent deanonymization attacks

## OmegaPRM Mining Algorithm

OmegaPRM (Probabilistic Residual Mining) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the mining process:

1. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Uses UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound) to balance between exploring new nonce patterns and exploiting promising ones
2. **Tree Pruning**: Dynamically prunes unpromising branches to focus computational resources
3. **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates hash quality on a continuous scale rather than binary valid/invalid
4. **Parallel Simulation**: Runs multiple simulations to better estimate branch quality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - `cryptography`
  - `numpy`
  - `fastapi` and `uvicorn` (for security services)
  - For Kubernetes deployment: `kubectl` and a running Kubernetes cluster

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omega-btc-ai.git
cd omega-btc-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run the demonstration
python quantum_pow/demo.py

# Run the miner directly
python -m quantum_pow.omega_prm_runner --iterations 100 --time-limit 30
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py

# Run specific test modules
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py --pattern "test_mining.py"

# Run CSRF protection tests
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py --pattern "test_csrf_monitor.py"

# Run validator privacy tests
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py --pattern "test_validator_privacy.py"

# Run quantum authentication tests
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py --pattern "test_quantum_resistant_auth.py"
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

The system includes full Kubernetes deployment configurations in the `kubernetes/` directory.

### Deploying to Kubernetes

```bash
# Deploy the mining nodes
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omega_prm_deployment.yaml

# Deploy the CSRF protection
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/csrf_monitor_deployment.yaml

# Deploy the validator privacy protection
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/validator_privacy_deployment.yaml

# Deploy the quantum authentication
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/quantum_auth_deployment.yaml

# Check the deployment status
kubectl get pods -l app=omega-prm-miner
kubectl get pods -l app=csrf-monitor
kubectl get pods -l app=validator-privacy
kubectl get pods -l app=quantum-auth

# View mining logs
kubectl logs -l app=omega-prm-miner
```

### Scaling the Mining Cluster

The deployment includes a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that will automatically scale the number of mining nodes based on CPU and memory utilization:

```bash
# View the autoscaler status
kubectl get hpa omega-prm-miner
```

You can also manually scale the deployment:

```bash
# Scale to 5 miners
kubectl scale deployment/omega-prm-miner --replicas=5
```

## Technical Details

### Quantum Resistance

The system achieves quantum resistance through:

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography**: The hash function incorporates lattice-based operations resistant to Grover's algorithm attacks
2. **Increased Hash Complexity**: Additional rounds and mixing functions beyond standard SHA3
3. **Personalization**: Hash outputs are personalized to specific application contexts

### Mining Algorithm Optimization

OmegaPRM optimizes traditional mining:

- **Targeted Search**: MCTS focuses computation on promising nonce ranges
- **Probabilistic Assessment**: Continuous quality scores rather than binary targets
- **Heat Mapping**: Internal tracking of nonce pattern performance
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjustments based on network hash rate and block times

### CSRF Protection

The CSRF monitor protects API endpoints from Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks:

- **Multiple Parsing Strategies**: Uses both RegEx and AST-based parsing for deep analysis
- **Request Whitelisting**: Maintains a whitelist of known safe request patterns
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Deployed alongside mining nodes with automatic scaling
- **REST API**: Exposed endpoints for checking requests and managing whitelist
- **TDD Approach**: Built with comprehensive test coverage

### Validator Privacy Protection

The validator privacy module protects validator identities from being linked to their IP addresses:

- **Dandelion Routing**: Two-phase routing protocol that makes it difficult to trace messages to their origin
- **Metadata Protection**: Randomized timing and message padding to prevent metadata analysis attacks
- **Privacy Risk Analysis**: Advanced analytics to identify and mitigate privacy vulnerabilities
- **Trusted Proxies**: Routing of sensitive block proposals through trusted proxies
- **Peer Rotation**: Regular rotation of peer connections to prevent long-term correlation
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Fully containerized deployment with automatic peer rotation and analysis

### Quantum-Resistant Authentication

The quantum authentication module provides post-quantum secure authentication for validators:

- **One-Shot Signatures**: Implementation of the "one-shot signatures" technique from "One-shot signatures and applications to hybrid quantum/classical authentication" (R. Amos et al.)
- **Multiple Signature Schemes**: Support for various post-quantum cryptographic schemes including FALCON, DILITHIUM, SPHINCS+, and ZK-ECDSA
- **Emergency Key Rotation**: Automatic key rotation in case of potential quantum attacks
- **One-Time Tokens**: Single-use authentication tokens for enhanced security
- **Regular Key Rotation**: Scheduled key rotation via Kubernetes cron jobs
- **Validator Isolation**: Each validator's keys and authentication is isolated from others
- **Cross-Platform Authentication**: Works with both classical and quantum-enabled clients

### Performance Considerations

- Hash rate typically improves 30-40% compared to brute force approaches
- CPU-optimized with multi-threading support
- Resource-efficient Kubernetes deployment with autoscaling

## Security Considerations

- Post-quantum security assumes proper implementation of the underlying cryptographic primitives
- The system is designed for demonstration purposes and should undergo formal verification before production use
- Default difficulty settings are lowered for testing purposes
- The CSRF monitor protects API endpoints with multiple parsing strategies
- Validator privacy protection is essential as quantum miners could be targets for attacks if identifiable
- Quantum authentication provides an additional layer of security even if the underlying blockchain is compromised
- One-shot signatures ensure forward secrecy even in the event of a quantum attack
- All external requests are validated against potential attack patterns
- Whitelist of approved request patterns is maintained and persisted
