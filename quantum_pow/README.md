# Quantum Proof-of-Work (qPoW)

*JAH BLESS SATOSHI*

## Overview

This is a theoretical implementation of a Quantum-resistant Proof-of-Work algorithm for a Bitcoin fork. The Quantum Proof-of-Work (qPoW) system leverages quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives to create a mining algorithm that remains secure even against quantum computer attacks.

## Features

- Quantum-resistant hash functions
- Modified block structure to support quantum signatures
- Backward compatibility with classical Bitcoin nodes
- Adaptive difficulty adjustment for quantum vs. classical miners
- Superposition state verification for quantum mining operations

## Theoretical Foundation

The qPoW system is based on the following quantum-resistant approaches:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography** - Resilient against quantum attacks using Shor's algorithm
2. **Hash-based signatures** - Using quantum-resistant hash functions such as SPHINCS+
3. **Multivariate polynomial cryptography** - Complex algebraic structures resistant to quantum computing
4. **Superposition mining** - Theoretical quantum mining that explores multiple nonce values simultaneously

## Test-Driven Development

This implementation follows strict TDD practices:

1. Write failing tests for quantum-resistant functions
2. Implement the functions to pass the tests
3. Refactor to optimize performance
4. Repeat for each component of the system

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- pytest for testing
- Simulated quantum computing environment (for testing quantum resistance)

## Implementation Status

This is currently a theoretical model and research project. It is not intended for production use but rather as a framework for exploring quantum-resistant blockchain mechanisms.
