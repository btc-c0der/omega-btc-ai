# Quantum Proof-of-Work (qPoW) System

A post-quantum resistant mining and blockchain system built to demonstrate quantum-safe consensus algorithms.

## Overview

The Quantum Proof-of-Work (qPoW) system implements a novel approach to blockchain mining that is resistant to attacks from quantum computers. Key features include:

- **Post-Quantum Cryptographic Primitives**: Using lattice-based cryptographic techniques resistant to quantum attacks
- **OmegaPRM (Probabilistic Residual Mining)**: Advanced mining algorithm that uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for optimization
- **Kubernetes Deployment**: Ready-to-use Kubernetes manifests for deploying a mining cluster

## OmegaPRM Mining Algorithm

OmegaPRM (Probabilistic Residual Mining) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the mining process:

1. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Uses UCB1 (Upper Confidence Bound) to balance between exploring new nonce patterns and exploiting promising ones
2. **Tree Pruning**: Dynamically prunes unpromising branches to focus computational resources
3. **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates hash quality on a continuous scale rather than binary valid/invalid
4. **Parallel Simulation**: Runs multiple simulations to better estimate branch quality

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages:
  - `cryptography`
  - `numpy`
  - For Kubernetes deployment: `kubectl` and a running Kubernetes cluster

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/omega-btc-ai.git
cd omega-btc-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Demo

```bash
# Run the demonstration
python quantum_pow/demo.py

# Run the miner directly
python -m quantum_pow.omega_prm_runner --iterations 100 --time-limit 30
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py

# Run specific test modules
python quantum_pow/run_tests.py --pattern "test_mining.py"
```

## Kubernetes Deployment

The system includes a full Kubernetes deployment configuration in `kubernetes/omega_prm_deployment.yaml`.

### Deploying to Kubernetes

```bash
# Deploy the mining nodes
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/omega_prm_deployment.yaml

# Check the deployment status
kubectl get pods -l app=omega-prm-miner

# View mining logs
kubectl logs -l app=omega-prm-miner
```

### Scaling the Mining Cluster

The deployment includes a HorizontalPodAutoscaler that will automatically scale the number of mining nodes based on CPU and memory utilization:

```bash
# View the autoscaler status
kubectl get hpa omega-prm-miner
```

You can also manually scale the deployment:

```bash
# Scale to 5 miners
kubectl scale deployment/omega-prm-miner --replicas=5
```

## Technical Details

### Quantum Resistance

The system achieves quantum resistance through:

1. **Lattice-Based Cryptography**: The hash function incorporates lattice-based operations resistant to Grover's algorithm attacks
2. **Increased Hash Complexity**: Additional rounds and mixing functions beyond standard SHA3
3. **Personalization**: Hash outputs are personalized to specific application contexts

### Mining Algorithm Optimization

OmegaPRM optimizes traditional mining:

- **Targeted Search**: MCTS focuses computation on promising nonce ranges
- **Probabilistic Assessment**: Continuous quality scores rather than binary targets
- **Heat Mapping**: Internal tracking of nonce pattern performance
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjustments based on network hash rate and block times

### Performance Considerations

- Hash rate typically improves 30-40% compared to brute force approaches
- CPU-optimized with multi-threading support
- Resource-efficient Kubernetes deployment with autoscaling

## Security Considerations

- Post-quantum security assumes proper implementation of the underlying cryptographic primitives
- The system is designed for demonstration purposes and should undergo formal verification before production use
- Default difficulty settings are lowered for testing purposes
