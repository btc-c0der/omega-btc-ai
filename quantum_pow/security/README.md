# Quantum Security Components

This directory contains security-related modules for the Quantum Proof-of-Work (qPoW) project, including CSRF protection, validator privacy protection, and quantum-resistant authentication systems.

## üåü Overview

The security components protect the qPoW network against various attack vectors, enhancing API security, validator privacy, and authentication security:

1. **Quantum CSRF Monitor**: Protects API endpoints from Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks using parsing strategies and whitelisting.

2. **Validator Privacy System**: Protects validator identities from being linked to their IP addresses through metadata analysis, using techniques like Dandelion routing and message padding.

3. **Quantum-Resistant Authentication**: Provides post-quantum secure authentication using one-shot signatures and other quantum-resistant techniques to protect validators against quantum computing attacks.

All components are designed to work within a Kubernetes environment and follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## üì¶ Component Architecture

### CSRF Protection

The CSRF protection system consists of:

- **CSRFRequest**: Encapsulates details of HTTP requests for analysis
- **ParsingStrategy**: Abstract interface for different request parsing strategies
- **SQLRegexParsingStrategy & SQLASTParsingStrategy**: Implementations for SQL injection detection
- **WhitelistManager**: Handles safe request whitelisting
- **CSRFMonitor**: Core component that coordinates parsing and whitelisting
- **CSRFProtectionMiddleware**: Integration point for web applications
- **REST API Server**: FastAPI-based server exposing endpoints for CSRF protection

### Validator Privacy Protection

The validator privacy system consists of:

- **ValidatorMetadata**: Tracks metadata associated with validators
- **DandelionRouting**: Implements the Dandelion routing protocol for enhanced privacy
- **ValidatorPrivacyManager**: Core component managing privacy protection mechanisms
- **PrivacyThreatLevel**: Enumerates different levels of privacy threats
- **REST API Server**: FastAPI-based server exposing endpoints for validator privacy management

### Quantum-Resistant Authentication

The quantum authentication system consists of:

- **SignatureScheme**: Enumerates supported quantum-resistant signature schemes
- **KeyPair**: Represents a quantum-resistant key pair with expiration management
- **OneTimeToken**: Implements one-time use authentication tokens
- **QuantumResistantAuth**: Core component managing authentication and key lifecycle
- **REST API Server**: FastAPI-based server exposing endpoints for quantum authentication

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Running the CSRF Monitor

```bash
# Run the CSRF monitor server
python -m quantum_pow.security.csrf_server --whitelist-file /path/to/whitelist.json
```

### Running the Validator Privacy Server

```bash
# Run the validator privacy server 
python -m quantum_pow.security.validator_privacy_server --config-file /path/to/config.json
```

### Running the Quantum Authentication Server

```bash
# Run the quantum authentication server
python -m quantum_pow.security.quantum_auth_server --config-file /path/to/config.json
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

Deploy the security components using the provided Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
# Deploy the CSRF monitor
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/csrf_monitor_deployment.yaml

# Deploy the validator privacy protection
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/validator_privacy_deployment.yaml

# Deploy the quantum authentication
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/quantum_auth_deployment.yaml
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Approaches

### CSRF Protection Strategies

The CSRF monitor employs multiple strategies to detect potentially malicious requests:

1. **Regular Expression Parsing**: Detects common attack patterns like SQL injections using regex
2. **AST-based Parsing**: Performs deeper analysis of request content
3. **Whitelisting**: Maintains a list of known-safe request patterns

### Validator Privacy Protection Techniques

The validator privacy system employs several techniques to prevent deanonymization:

1. **Dandelion Routing**: Two-phase routing protocol (stem phase + fluff phase) that makes it difficult to trace messages to their origin
2. **Metadata Obfuscation**:
   - Randomized timing of attestations and block proposals
   - Random padding of messages to prevent size-based correlation
   - Use of trusted proxies for sensitive communications
3. **Privacy Risk Analysis**: Real-time analysis of metadata patterns to detect potential privacy leakages
4. **Regular Peer Rotation**: Prevents long-term traffic analysis

### Quantum-Resistant Authentication Techniques

The quantum authentication system employs several techniques to ensure post-quantum security:

1. **One-Shot Signatures**: Signatures that can only be used once, ensuring security even if the private key is later compromised
2. **Multiple Post-Quantum Schemes**:
   - FALCON and DILITHIUM: Lattice-based signature schemes
   - SPHINCS+: Hash-based signature scheme without mathematical assumptions
   - ZK-ECDSA: Classical ECDSA enhanced with zero-knowledge proofs
3. **Key Lifecycle Management**:
   - Automatic expiration of keys
   - Emergency key rotation
   - Regular key rotation via Kubernetes cron jobs
4. **One-Time Authentication Tokens**: Provides an additional layer of security for session management

## üß™ Testing

All components include comprehensive test suites following TDD principles:

```bash
# Run CSRF protection tests
python -m unittest quantum_pow.tests.test_csrf_monitor

# Run validator privacy tests
python -m unittest quantum_pow.tests.test_validator_privacy

# Run quantum authentication tests
python -m unittest quantum_pow.tests.test_quantum_resistant_auth
```

## üìä Performance Considerations

- The CSRF monitor is designed to be lightweight and impose minimal overhead on API requests
- The validator privacy system introduces some intentional latency to randomize timing patterns
- The quantum authentication system is designed for efficient verification even with larger signature sizes
- All components are designed to scale horizontally in Kubernetes environments

## üîÑ Inspirations

These security components were inspired by:

1. **CSRF Protection**: Apache ModSecurity CSRF project
2. **Validator Privacy**:
   - Ethereum's validator privacy research ("Packetology: Validator Privacy")
   - Dandelion routing protocol for cryptocurrencies
   - Advanced P2P security techniques from the blockchains-security-toolkit
3. **Quantum Authentication**:
   - "One-shot signatures and applications to hybrid quantum/classical authentication" (R. Amos et al.)
   - NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process
   - "Quantum resistance: taking proof of keys day to the next level" (J. Loop, 2022)
   - "ZK ECDSA with quantum proof keypairs" (yush_g discussion)
