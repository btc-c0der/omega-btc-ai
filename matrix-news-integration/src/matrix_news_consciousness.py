Matrix News Consciousness Service
================================

This service provides consciousness-aligned news integration for the Matrix Portal.
It enhances news data with:
- Consciousness level detection and adaptation
- Quantum balance of diverse perspectives
- Temporal contextualization of news items
- Truth probability analysis

The service interfaces with:
- Existing News Service (running in the sacred container)
- Temporal Contextualizer service
- Redis for data storage
- The Matrix Portal frontend
