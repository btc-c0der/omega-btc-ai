# Divine Quantum NFT Smart Contracts

This directory contains the Solidity smart contracts for the quantum-resistant NFT implementation used in the Divine Dashboard v3 platform.

## Contracts

### DivineQuantumNFT.sol

The main NFT contract with the following features:

- ERC-721 standard compliant with additional security features
- Quantum resistance through secure hash verification
- Royalty support via ERC-2981
- IPFS integration for metadata and content
- On-chain fallback rendering capabilities

### NFTQuantumValidator.sol

A validator contract that provides quantum security features:

- Quantum hash registration and management
- Secure signature generation for minting
- Role-based access control
- Timing constraints for increased security

## Architecture

The system uses a two-contract approach:

1. **DivineQuantumNFT**: The main NFT contract that users interact with
2. **NFTQuantumValidator**: A separate contract that validates quantum signatures

This separation of concerns improves security by isolating the validation logic from the main NFT functionality.

## Security Features

### Quantum Resistance

The contracts implement quantum resistance through:

- Post-quantum cryptographic hashing algorithms (off-chain)
- Time-delayed hash registration
- Hash-based signatures that are resistant to quantum attacks
- Hash chain verification for additional security

### Role-Based Access Control

Different roles exist within the system:

- Admin: Can configure contract settings
- Minter: Can mint new NFTs
- Validator: Can validate quantum signatures
- Quantum Provider: Can register new quantum hashes

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy these contracts:

1. Deploy the `NFTQuantumValidator` contract first
2. Deploy the `DivineQuantumNFT` contract, passing the validator address
3. Call `authorizeNFTContract` on the validator to authorize the NFT contract

## Integration with Dashboard

The contracts integrate with the Divine Dashboard v3 through:

- JavaScript API for contract interaction
- Backend validation of quantum hashes
- Frontend components for displaying NFT information
- IPFS integration for content storage

## Development Setup

Requirements:

- Solidity 0.8.20+
- OpenZeppelin contracts
- Hardhat or Truffle for development and testing
- Ethers.js or Web3.js for frontend integration

## License

All contracts are released under the MIT License.
