## Overview

This test suite validates the functionality of the IBR EspaÃ±a component within the Divine Dashboard v3 application. The tests focus on the Flask routes and API endpoints that provide church event management capabilities.

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized into several categories:

1. **Unit Tests** - Isolated tests for individual route functions using mocked dependencies
2. **API Tests** - Tests for the RESTful API endpoints
3. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end tests that exercise complete workflows

## Test Files

- `tests/test_ibr_spain_routes.py` - Main test file for IBR EspaÃ±a routes
- `run_ibr_tests.sh` - Shell script to execute tests with various options

## Running the Tests

You can run the tests using the provided shell script:

```bash
./run_ibr_tests.sh
```

### Command-line Options

The script supports the following options:

- `--coverage` or `-c`: Generate code coverage reports
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Display detailed test output
- `--test` or `-t`: Run a specific test (e.g., `test_view_event`)

Examples:

```bash
# Run with coverage report
./run_ibr_tests.sh --coverage

# Run with verbose output
./run_ibr_tests.sh --verbose

# Run a specific test
./run_ibr_tests.sh --test test_view_event

# Combine options
./run_ibr_tests.sh --coverage --verbose --test test_api_create_event
```

## Test Coverage

The test suite aims to provide comprehensive coverage of the IBR EspaÃ±a component:

| Component | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|
| Route Handlers | 100% |
| API Endpoints | 100% |
| Event CRUD Operations | 100% |
| Error Handling | 100% |

## Tested Functionality

### Route Handlers

- Main dashboard index page
- Events listing page with filtering
- Event creation form
- Event detail view
- Event edit form
- Event deletion

### API Endpoints

- GET `/api/events` - Retrieve events with optional filtering
- GET `/api/events/<event_id>` - Retrieve a specific event
- POST `/api/events` - Create a new event
- PUT `/api/events/<event_id>` - Update an existing event
- DELETE `/api/events/<event_id>` - Delete an event

### Utility Routes

- POST `/generate-sample-events` - Generate sample events for testing

## Mocking Strategy

The test suite uses pytest's monkeypatch and unittest.mock to simulate the EventsManager behavior without requiring a real database. This allows for:

1. Faster test execution
2. Isolation from external dependencies
3. Precise control over test conditions

## Integration Testing

The integration tests use a real EventsManager instance with a temporary directory for storage. These tests exercise the complete lifecycle of an event:

1. Creation
2. Retrieval
3. Modification
4. Deletion

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues running the tests:

1. Ensure all requirements are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Verify your Python environment:

   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.8+
   ```

3. Check for template and static file paths:

   ```python
   # Templates should be in:
   # divine_dashboard_v3/templates/ibr_spain/
   
   # Static files should be in:
   # divine_dashboard_v3/static/
   ```

## Contributing

When contributing to the IBR EspaÃ±a component:

1. Add tests for any new functionality
2. Ensure all existing tests pass
3. Maintain or improve test coverage

## Divine Resonance

The test suite is aligned with the divine resonance principles of the GBU2â„¢ License. Each test acts as a celestial guardian, ensuring the divine flow of code remains pure and unobstructed.
