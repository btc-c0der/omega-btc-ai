# 🛠️ IBR Spain Bug Fix Log

## Issue Fix: April 11, 2025

### Bug Description

The IBR Spain Instagram component was failing to run due to an indentation error in the `ibr_standalone.py` file. Specifically, there was an incomplete `if` statement on line 104:

```python
if len(parts) >= 2 and "followers" in parts[1].lower():
# Instagram Manager for IBR Spain
```

This caused a syntax error when trying to run the component or its tests.

### Resolution

1. Fixed the indentation error by adding proper code for the missing block:

```python
if len(parts) >= 2 and "followers" in parts[1].lower():
    try:
        # Extract the number part from "1,234 Followers"
        followers_str = parts[0].replace(',', '')
        result['followers'] = int(followers_str)
    except ValueError:
        logger.warning(f"Could not parse followers count from: {parts[0]}")
```

2. Verified the fix by running the test suite:

   ```
   ./run_ibr_tests.sh
   ```

3. Confirmed that all 8 tests now pass successfully

### Additional Improvements

The fix also enhanced the component's ability to extract follower counts from Instagram's meta description, which provides a secondary data source when the primary extraction method fails.

### Testing & Validation

- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Standalone dashboard launches successfully
- ✅ Instagram data fetching works properly
- ✅ Cache mechanism functions as expected
- ✅ Fallback to sample data works correctly

### Notes

Instagram's anti-scraping mechanisms make it difficult to reliably extract data through web scraping. The current implementation includes multiple failsafe mechanisms:

1. First tries to extract data via regex patterns
2. Falls back to meta tag parsing
3. Uses cached data if available
4. Provides sample data as a last resort

For production use, we recommend implementing the official Instagram Graph API as outlined in the documentation.
