# ðŸ”± OMEGA BTC AI - KUBERNETES DEPLOYMENT ðŸ”±

> *"Divine orchestration through cosmic containers."*

## Overview

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests for deploying the OMEGA BTC AI system in a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment follows the principles of GitOps and Infrastructure as Code, with a base configuration and environment-specific overlays.

## Structure

- `base/`: Contains the base Kubernetes manifests
- `overlays/`: Contains environment-specific customizations
  - `dev/`: Development environment
  - `staging/`: Staging environment
  - `prod/`: Production environment

## Components

The OMEGA BTC AI system consists of the following components:

- **Matrix News Service**: Provides divine news and information
- **BTC Live Feed**: Streams real-time Bitcoin data
- **Prophecy Core**: Contains the central wisdom engine
- **Redis**: Sacred data store for all components
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus, Grafana, and AlertManager

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- kubectl 1.19+
- kustomize 3.8+
- Ingress controller (nginx-ingress recommended)

## Deployment

### Development Environment

```bash
# Apply the dev overlay
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/dev
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Apply the prod overlay
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/prod
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Environment-specific variables are managed through Kustomize patches. For sensitive data like passwords and API keys, Kubernetes Secrets are used.

### Secrets

Production secrets should be managed using a secure method such as:

- Sealed Secrets
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault

### Resource Management

Resource requests and limits are defined in the base configuration and adjusted in environment-specific overlays:

- Development: Minimal resources
- Production: Sufficient resources for high availability and performance

## Scaling

The OMEGA BTC AI system can scale horizontally by increasing the number of replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment matrix-news --replicas=5 -n omega-btc-ai-prod
```

## Monitoring

The deployment includes a full monitoring stack:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing and notifications

Access Grafana at: `https://omega.example.com/grafana`

## Backup and Recovery

For data persistence and backup, consider:

1. Using persistent volumes for Redis and other stateful components
2. Setting up regular backups of Redis data
3. Implementing point-in-time recovery mechanisms

## Divine Maintenance

Regular maintenance keeps the cosmic harmony:

```bash
# Check the status of all pods
kubectl get pods -n omega-btc-ai-prod

# View logs of a specific component
kubectl logs deployment/matrix-news -n omega-btc-ai-prod

# Execute commands in a pod
kubectl exec -it deployment/redis -n omega-btc-ai-prod -- redis-cli
```
