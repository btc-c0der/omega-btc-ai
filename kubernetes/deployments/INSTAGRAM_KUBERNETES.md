# ðŸ”± OMEGA BTC AI - Divine Instagram Kubernetes Integration ðŸ”±

This document explains how to deploy and manage the OMEGA BTC AI Instagram automation using Kubernetes.

## Overview

The Instagram automation service has been containerized and configured for Kubernetes deployment, providing:

- **Reliability**: Automatic restarts if the service crashes
- **Scalability**: Easily deploy multiple instances for different accounts
- **Security**: Instagram credentials stored as Kubernetes secrets
- **Persistence**: Images and session data stored on persistent volumes
- **Scheduling**: Religious content posted via CronJob every Sunday

## Components

The setup includes:

1. **Docker Image**: Contains the Instagram automation script and dependencies
2. **ConfigMap**: Stores Instagram configuration (hashtags, templates, etc.)
3. **Secret**: Securely stores Instagram credentials
4. **Deployment**: Runs the Instagram automation service
5. **PersistentVolumeClaim**: Stores generated images and session data
6. **Service**: Exposes metrics endpoint
7. **CronJob**: Schedules religious content for IBR church in Catalonia

## Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster running (e.g., Docker Desktop, minikube, kind)
- kubectl installed and configured
- Docker installed for building the image

### Deploy Using the Script

The simplest way to deploy is using the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/k8s_instagram_deploy.sh
```

This script:

1. Builds the Docker image
2. Creates the omega-system namespace if needed
3. Applies all Kubernetes manifests
4. Waits for the deployment to be ready
5. Displays status and helpful commands

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer to deploy manually:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t localhost/omega-instagram:latest -f Dockerfile.instagram .
   ```

2. Apply the Kubernetes manifests:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f kubernetes/deployments/omega-instagram-deployment.yaml
   ```

## Configuration

### Instagram Credentials

Before the deployment works, you must update the Instagram credentials:

```bash
# Create a temporary file with your credentials
cat <<EOF > instagram-creds.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: instagram-credentials
  namespace: omega-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  IG_USERNAME: "your_actual_username"
  IG_PASSWORD: "your_actual_password"
EOF

# Apply the credentials
kubectl apply -f instagram-creds.yaml

# Delete the temporary file
rm instagram-creds.yaml
```

### Configuration Options

To modify other settings (posting frequency, hashtags, etc.):

```bash
kubectl edit configmap instagram-config -n omega-system
```

After changing the config, restart the deployment:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/omega-instagram -n omega-system
```

## Monitoring

### Check Logs

```bash
# Follow logs for the Instagram automation
kubectl logs -f -n omega-system -l app=omega-instagram
```

### Check Status

```bash
# Get pods status
kubectl get pods -n omega-system -l app=omega-instagram

# Get deployment status
kubectl describe deployment omega-instagram -n omega-system
```

### Religious Posts CronJob

To check the status of the religious posts CronJob:

```bash
kubectl get cronjobs -n omega-system
```

To manually trigger a religious post:

```bash
kubectl create job --from=cronjob/instagram-religious-post manual-religious-post -n omega-system
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pod Won't Start

If the pod is stuck in "Pending" state:

```bash
kubectl describe pod -n omega-system -l app=omega-instagram
```

Common issues:

- Insufficient cluster resources
- PersistentVolumeClaim not being bound
- Image pull issues

### Authentication Failures

If the logs show authentication failures:

1. Verify your credentials are correct
2. Check if Instagram may be blocking automation attempts
3. Try manually updating the credentials:

```bash
kubectl edit secret instagram-credentials -n omega-system
```

Remember: You need to base64 encode values when directly editing secrets.

## Scaling

To increase the number of replicas:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment omega-instagram -n omega-system --replicas=2
```

Note: Running multiple replicas with the same Instagram account may cause issues. This is more useful for running different accounts.
