"""
Tests for the WebSocket Server Component with Improved Error Handling.

This test suite demonstrates best practices for testing asynchronous WebSocket components:
1. Proper mocking of async WebSocket connections and clients
2. Testing error handling paths for WebSocket communication
3. Handling connection errors gracefully
4. Testing broadcast functionality with multiple clients
5. Demonstrating improved error-handling implementations

The tests are organized to cover both the current implementation and show how it
could be improved with better error handling for production use.
