## Mathematical Principles

The RASTA BitGet Discord Bot applies these key mathematical principles:

### Golden Ratio (Ï†)

The Divine Proportion (approximately 1.618) is used to evaluate:

- Ideal ratios between long and short exposure
- Target levels for entries and exits
- Overall portfolio structure

### Fibonacci Sequence

The sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...) is used for:

- Position sizing recommendations (as percentages of account)
- Risk management guidance
- Harmonization of multiple positions
