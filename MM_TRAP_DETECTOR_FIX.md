# MM Trap Detector Integration Fix

## Issue

The BTC live feed was failing to import the MM Trap Detector module, resulting in the following error:

```
WARNING: MM Trap Detector module not available!
```

This error occurred because there were issues with the import structure and function compatibility between the MM Trap Detector and the BTC live feed.

## Causes

1. **Repeated Import Attempts**: The BTC live feed was attempting to import the MM Trap Detector module inside the `on_message` function, which is called frequently, leading to repeated import attempts.

2. **Lack of Error Handling**: There was no proper error handling to catch and manage import failures.

3. **Improper Initialization**: The MM Trap Detector module lacked proper initialization in its `__init__.py` file.

4. **Database Function Name Change**: The function `insert_mm_trap` was renamed to `insert_possible_mm_trap` in the database module, but this change wasn't propagated to all the files that use it.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Move Import to Module Level**:
   - Moved the MM Trap Detector import to the module level of `btc_live_feed.py`
   - Added error handling for the import

2. **Added Flag in Redis**:
   - Created a flag to prevent repeated warning messages about the MM Trap Detector's availability

3. **Created Proper `__init__.py`**:
   - Added a comprehensive `__init__.py` file for the MM Trap Detector package
   - This initializes components properly and exports the necessary members

4. **Created Diagnostic Tool**:
   - Developed the `check_mm_trap_detector.py` script to check the status of all components
   - It verifies imports, Redis connections, and module availability

5. **Updated Function Name References**:
   - Updated references to `insert_mm_trap` in multiple files to use `insert_possible_mm_trap` instead
   - This included changing imports and function calls in:
     - `mm_trap_detector.py`
     - `high_frequency_detector.py`
     - `grafana_reporter.py`
   - Also updated the function call signature to match the new function format that accepts a dictionary

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Run the diagnostic tool:

   ```bash
   python check_mm_trap_detector.py
   ```

   This should show "All systems operational" and "MM Trap Detector is available to BTC Live Feed".

2. Run the BTC live feed:

   ```bash
   python -m omega_ai.data_feed.btc_live_feed
   ```

   The warning about MM Trap Detector not being available should no longer appear.

## Additional Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added more robust error capture and reporting throughout the MM Trap Detector modules

2. **Better Logging**:
   - Improved log messages to make it clearer when components are loaded successfully

3. **Improved Module Initialization**:
   - Made module initialization more robust with try-except blocks

4. **Fixed DateTime References**:
   - Corrected instances of `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` to use the proper imported format `datetime.now(UTC)`

5. **Fixed InfluxDB Query API Check**:
   - Added a check for `query_api is not None` before attempting to use it in Grafana reporter

These improvements make the integration between the BTC live feed and MM Trap Detector more reliable and prevent cryptic error messages.
