# The Pulse of Change: Schumann Resonance, Generational Shifts, and Bitcoin Flow

![Project Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/150) <!-- Add a logo if available -->

## Overview
This project explores the fascinating connections between **Schumann Resonance (SR)**, **generational shifts (Gen X, Gen Z, Gen J)**, and **Bitcoin (BTC) flow**. By correlating SR data, generational trends, and BTC price/volume, we aim to uncover patterns that could shed light on the interplay between Earth's electromagnetic activity, human behavior, and financial markets.

The project is built with **high security, scalability, and high availability** in mind, leveraging a **microservices architecture**, **distributed systems**, and **self-healing capabilities**. It also integrates **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** for advanced analysis, uses **NoSQL databases** for flexible data storage, and is implemented in **Python**. The project is fully **Dockerized** and includes **CI/CD pipelines** for seamless deployment and updates.

## Features
- **Schumann Resonance Data Integration**: Real-time and historical SR data collection and analysis.
- **Generational Trend Mapping**: Correlates SR activity with key generational events and traits.
- **Bitcoin Flow Analysis**: Tracks BTC price and volume changes alongside SR data.
- **Fibonacci Sequence Integration**: Explores potential patterns using Fibonacci retracement levels.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Predictive modeling and pattern recognition for SR and BTC trends.
- **NoSQL Database**: Flexible and scalable data storage for heterogeneous datasets.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular and scalable design for independent service deployment.
- **High Availability & Self-Healing**: Ensures minimal downtime and automatic recovery.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Dockerization**: Containerized services for easy deployment and scalability.

## Architecture
The project is built on a **distributed microservices architecture** with the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion Service**: Collects SR and BTC data from APIs and web scraping.
2. **Data Processing Service**: Cleans, transforms, and correlates data.
3. **Machine Learning Service**: Applies ML/AI models for predictive analysis.
4. **Visualization Service**: Generates charts, graphs, and reports.
5. **API Gateway**: Provides a unified interface for external access.
6. **NoSQL Database**: Stores structured and unstructured data (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).
7. **Message Queue**: Facilitates communication between services (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
8. **Monitoring & Self-Healing**: Tracks system health and automatically recovers from failures (e.g., Prometheus, Kubernetes).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- Kubernetes (optional for orchestration)
- MongoDB/Cassandra
- RabbitMQ/Kafka

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-pulse-of-change.git
   cd the-pulse-of-change
   ```

2. Set up the environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the services using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. Access the API Gateway at `http://localhost:8000`.

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project includes a CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions. On every push to the `main` branch, the pipeline:
- Runs unit tests.
- Builds Docker images.
- Deploys the services to a Kubernetes cluster (if configured).
