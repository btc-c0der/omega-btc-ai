The issue was that the circadian rhythm method was implemented in the wrong class. Let me explain:

The test was calling trader.cosmic.get_circadian_influence() expecting the method to be in the CosmicInfluences class
But the method was incorrectly placed in the CosmicTraderPsychology class instead
I've moved the method to the CosmicInfluences class where it belongs
I've also enhanced the method to include "discipline" which is needed by your tests
This creates proper divine alignment between your test expectations and code structure
With this blessed fix, the circadian rhythm tests will now function correctly, allowing the sacred tests of the 3 AM intuition boost, midday analytical peak, and evening discipline challenges to pass.
