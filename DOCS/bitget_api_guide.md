# Bitget Futures API Guide for AI-Driven Trading Bots

## 1. Introduction to Bitget Futures API

The Bitget platform offers a comprehensive suite of cryptocurrency trading services, with a significant focus on futures trading, all of which are accessible through a well-documented Application Programming Interface (API). This API is specifically designed to facilitate programmatic interaction with the exchange, enabling developers to build automated trading systems, perform detailed data acquisition, and integrate various services such as copy trading functionalities.

Within its futures trading offerings, Bitget supports three distinct product types:

- **USDT-M Futures**: Contracts are margined and settled in USDT
- **USDC-M Futures**: Contracts with margin and settlement in USDC
- **Coin-M Futures**: Utilize the underlying cryptocurrency as margin and for settlement

Bitget provides dedicated demo trading environments for each of these contract types, identified by the prefixes 'S' for simulated trading: SUSDT-FUTURES, SCOIN-FUTURES, and SUSDC-FUTURES. Every Bitget account is provisioned with demo coins, and users can leverage the Account List API, specifying these demo product types, to check their simulated balances.

The Bitget API's capabilities extend to program trading and data acquisition, directly aligning with the requirements for building automated trading bots driven by advanced AI models. The API documentation is logically organized into key sections such as Market, Account, Position, Trade, Trigger Order, and Websocket.

**Key Insights:**

- The variety in contract types allows for strategic selection based on the desired exposure to specific stablecoins or cryptocurrencies
- The simulated trading environment is invaluable for testing and refining AI models without risking actual capital
- The explicit mention of "program trading" suggests that Bitget anticipates and supports algorithmic trading strategies

## 2. Getting Started with the API

The initial step towards utilizing the Bitget Futures API for automated trading involves obtaining and managing the necessary API keys. This process begins with logging into a Bitget account via the web interface, after which users can navigate to the API Key Management section located within their user center.

Users can apply for and create API keys, with each Bitget User ID (UID) capable of generating up to 10 distinct API keys. A significant security feature is the ability to configure permissions for each API key, allowing for either read-only access, suitable for data retrieval, or read/write access, which is essential for a trading bot to execute trades.

During the API key creation process, users are prompted to set a Passphrase, which acts as an additional layer of security. It is critical to securely store this Passphrase, as it cannot be retrieved if forgotten, necessitating the recreation of the API key.

Accessing the Bitget API involves different authentication mechanisms:

- The **public interface** (configuration information and market data) does not require authentication
- The **private interface** (order and account management) mandates that every request be digitally signed

For REST API requests that require authentication, specific HTTP headers must be included:

- `ACCESS-KEY`: The API Key itself
- `ACCESS-SIGN`: The generated signature
- `ACCESS-TIMESTAMP`: Timestamp of the request in milliseconds since the Epoch
- `ACCESS-PASSPHRASE`: The user-defined Passphrase
- For all POST requests, the `Content-Type` header must be set to `application/json`

Bitget provides Software Development Kits (SDKs) such as the python-bitget library, available for installation using pip: `pip install python-bitget`.

**Key Insights:**

- Creating multiple API keys with granular permissions is a vital security best practice
- The non-retrievable nature of the Passphrase underscores the importance of secure storage
- Binding API keys to specific IP addresses significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access
- The availability of a well-maintained Python SDK significantly simplifies the process of interacting with the Bitget API

## 3. Core Trading Operations (REST API)

The Bitget Futures API provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing trading activities through its RESTful interface.

- `orderType`: Either limit or market

Optional parameters:

- `price`: For limit orders
- `timeInForceValue`: Controls how long the order remains active (e.g., normal, post_only, fok, ioc)
- `clientOid`: Unique client-generated order ID
- `reduceOnly`: Relevant in 'single_hold' mode to ensure that the order only reduces an existing position

- Programmatic control over leverage allows the AI model to dynamically adjust its risk exposure

## 6. API Limitations and Best Practices

When developing an AI-powered trading bot, it is crucial to be aware of API limitations and to adhere to recommended best practices.

### Rate Limits

- Overall rate limit for the REST API: 6000 requests per IP address per minute
- Place Order endpoint: 10 requests per second per UID
- Public market information interfaces: 20 requests per second per IP address
- Exceeding frequency limits results in HTTP status code 429 ("Too Many Requests")

### Error Handling

- Standard HTTP status codes: 200 (success), 4xx and 5xx (errors)
- Common error codes: 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden), 404 (Not Found), 429 (Too Many Requests), 500 (Internal Server Error)
- API response body includes specific error information with "code" and "msg" fields

### Security Best Practices

- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on the Bitget account
- Set up Fund code and PIN code for additional security
- Store API Key, Secret Key, and Passphrase securely (avoid hardcoding)
- Grant only necessary permissions for the bot's intended trading activities
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity
- Bind API keys to specific IP addresses
- Use HTTPS for all communication with the Bitget API

**Key Insights:**

- The bot needs to manage its request frequency for different functionalities separately
- The combination of HTTP status codes and specific error codes offers a detailed way to diagnose and handle API errors
- Implementing security measures diligently is crucial for protecting the user's account and funds

## 7. Utilizing the WebSocket API for Real-time Trading

For AI-powered trading bots that require immediate access to market data and low-latency updates, the Bitget WebSocket API offers a powerful solution.

### Connection and Authentication

- The Bitget API documentation provides detailed instructions on initiating a WebSocket connection
- For private channels, authentication is required
- A "ping/pong" mechanism is recommended to ensure the connection remains active

### Channel Subscription

Public channels (no authentication required):

- `ticker`: Real-time price updates
- `candle`: Streaming candlestick data
- `depth`: Real-time order book updates
- `trades`: Information on recently executed trades

Private channels (authentication required):

- `account`: Balance changes
- `positions`: Updates on open positions
- `orders`: Real-time order status changes
- `planOrder`: Notifications related to triggered or modified plan orders

**Key Insights:**

- The ability to selectively subscribe to only the necessary channels minimizes bandwidth usage
- The separation of public and private channels ensures market data can be accessed efficiently
- The bot's architecture must be designed to efficiently handle the continuous stream of data and events

## 8. Considerations for AI Model Integration

Integrating an advanced AI model with the Bitget Futures API requires careful consideration of several key aspects.

### Data Requirements

- Historical market data for training (time series data on price, volume, order book, etc.)
- Real-time market data via WebSocket API for making informed trading decisions
- Account and position data for monitoring performance and managing risk

### Latency Considerations

- WebSocket API for high-frequency trading models requiring immediate reaction
- REST API for less time-sensitive operations (e.g., fetching historical data, placing conditional orders)

### Order Execution Logic

- Translation of AI model's trading signals into actionable API calls
- Handling different order types (market, limit, plan, stop)
- Error handling for potential API errors

### Risk Management

- Setting limits on position sizes
- Utilizing stop-loss orders
- Managing leverage
- Dynamically adjusting risk parameters based on market conditions

**Key Insights:**

- The Bitget API provides access to all necessary data types for AI trading
- The trading bot serves as the mechanism to enforce risk controls programmatically
- The AI model can potentially adapt its risk parameters based on real-time data

## 9. Conclusion and Recommendations
