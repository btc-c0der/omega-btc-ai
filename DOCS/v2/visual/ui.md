hello again :)

shall we work on the visualization side of parts? suggestion to create a new branch if possible

so the guidance from my side would be:

- we love 3D, 4D, 5D all vectors that the open source (we love) libraries can provide, there are no limits to our imagination
- TDD is highly recommended and somehow we could make it a rule, I sense it is the way to go SW dev wise
- In case we hit a glitch, it is fine to pause the generation or execution and we can do it from my side ("client" side)
- it seems we do have (again sorry) some duplication, if it is not too much trouble, please double check what we can make DRY
- extras: README udpate, pydoc, logs with some OMEGA AI EXCHANGE labels and that (haxor and rastafari) mix looking? I sense we need to define a UI design patter (more like theme wise)  and I will try to stick to that :) so the mood is half ethical hacker / half Patois Marcus Garvey, Rasta, The Emperor Haile Selassie I, reggae, etc... all connected... if we could actually try to innovate and mix "hacker" with "reagge" it would be superb. Also we can go creative with media, sounds, wavs, that would be triggered by systems events, e.g. traps
