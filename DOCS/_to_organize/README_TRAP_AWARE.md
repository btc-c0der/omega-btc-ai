This script provides pre-configured settings for common scenarios:

```bash
./run_trap_aware_preset.sh [PRESET] [SYMBOL]
```

#### Available Presets

- `conservative` - Low risk, low capital, trap protection enabled
- `balanced` - Medium risk, medium capital, trap protection enabled
- `aggressive` - High risk, high capital, higher leverage
- `elite-exits` - Enables elite exit strategy with high confidence
- `no-protection` - Runs without trap protection features
- `testnet` - Runs on testnet with conservative settings

Example:

```bash
./run_trap_aware_preset.sh balanced ETHUSDT
```

### 3. Elite Exit Script: `run_elite_exit_trader.sh`

This script is specialized for configuring and running with different Elite Exit strategies:

```bash
./run_elite_exit_trader.sh [CONFIDENCE] [SYMBOL] [LEVERAGE]
```

Where:

- `CONFIDENCE` is the elite exit confidence threshold (0.5-0.95)
- `SYMBOL` is the trading symbol (default: BTCUSDT)
- `LEVERAGE` is the trading leverage (default: 10)

Example:

```bash
./run_elite_exit_trader.sh 0.8 BTCUSDT 15
```

## Elite Exit Strategy Explained

The Elite Exit Strategy uses market data and technical indicators to make intelligent exit decisions. It provides:

- Dynamic stop loss management
- Profit target optimization
- Trend reversal detection
- Risk-adjusted position sizing

### Confidence Threshold

The confidence threshold (0.5-0.95) determines how selective the exit strategy will be:

- **0.5-0.65**: Aggressive exits, higher trade frequency, smaller average profits
- **0.7-0.8**: Balanced approach, good for normal market conditions
- **0.8-0.9**: Conservative, will only exit on strong signals
- **>0.9**: Extremely selective, may rarely trigger exits

## Trap Protection

The trap protection system helps detect and respond to market maker traps such as:

- Bull traps
- Bear traps
- Liquidity grabs
- Stop hunts
- Fake pumps/dumps

When a trap is detected, the system adjusts risk parameters automatically based on the type of trap.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your API keys are set in your environment variables
2. Run the preset script to choose a trading style:

   ```bash
   ./run_trap_aware_preset.sh balanced
   ```

3. For more advanced elite exit configuration:

   ```bash
   ./run_elite_exit_trader.sh 0.75
   ```

4. For full manual configuration:

   ```bash
   python run_trap_aware_dual_traders.py --enable-elite-exits --elite-exit-confidence 0.8 --symbol BTCUSDT --long-leverage 10 --short-leverage 10
   ```

## Monitoring

The system outputs detailed logging information to help monitor its performance. Look for:

- Trap detection events
- Elite exit signals
- Position entries and exits
- Performance metrics

Log files are written to `trap_aware_trading.log` by default.

## Safety Features

- Minimum balance requirements prevent trading if account balance is too low
- Maximum account value limits help manage risk
- Sub-account separation between long and short positions
- Trap detection provides an additional layer of protection against market manipulation
