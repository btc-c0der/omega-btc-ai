## System Overview

OMEGA BTC AI is an advanced cryptocurrency trading system that combines real-time market monitoring, AI-powered pattern recognition, and sophisticated trading strategies. The system specializes in detecting market maker traps (manipulation tactics) and executing optimized trading strategies in response.

### Core Features

- **Market Maker Trap Detection**: Identifies manipulation tactics such as liquidity grabs, stop hunts, and fake breakouts
- **Dual Position Trading**: Simultaneous long and short positions managed by different sub-accounts
- **Elite Exit Strategies**: Sophisticated exit decision-making based on multiple market factors
- **Real-time Monitoring**: WebSocket-based price feeds with sub-second updates
- **BitGet Exchange Integration**: Complete futures trading implementation with sub-account support
- **Advanced Fibonacci Analysis**: Multi-timeframe Fibonacci level calculation and confluence detection
- **Redis-powered Data Flow**: High-performance data synchronization between components

## Architecture

The OMEGA BTC AI system consists of several interacting components:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Real-time BTC price data from exchanges
   - Market data stored in Redis for immediate access
   - Historical data persisted to PostgreSQL

2. **Analysis Layer**
   - Market maker trap detection
   - Fibonacci level calculation
   - Pattern recognition
   - Multi-timeframe trend analysis

3. **Trading Layer**
   - BitGet integration for futures trading
   - Dual position traders (long and short)
   - Position management
   - Risk control

4. **Visualization**
   - Real-time performance dashboards
   - Trap pattern visualization
   - Position flow tracking

### Component Organization

The system is organized into multiple Python modules:

- `data_feed/`: Real-time price data ingestion
- `mm_trap_detector/`: Market manipulation detection
- `trading/strategies/`: Trading strategies implementation
- `trading/exchanges/`: Exchange-specific implementations
- `utils/`: Helper functions and utilities
- `alerts/`: Notification system (Telegram, etc.)
- `visualization/`: Data visualization components

## Trap-Aware Dual Position Traders

The flagship component of OMEGA BTC AI is the Trap-Aware Dual Position Traders system, which enhances traditional trading strategies with market maker trap awareness.

### How It Works

1. The system monitors real-time price data and calculates trap probability
2. When potential traps are detected, it adjusts trading parameters accordingly
3. Different trap types trigger different responses:
   - Bull traps ‚Üí Reduce long risk, increase short risk
   - Bear traps ‚Üí Reduce short risk, increase long risk
   - Liquidity grabs ‚Üí Reduce risk on both sides
4. Elite exit strategies determine optimal exit points based on multiple factors

### Trap Types Detected

- **Bull Trap (üêÇ)**: False breakout above resistance to trap buyers
- **Bear Trap (üêª)**: False breakdown below support to trap sellers  
- **Liquidity Grab (üí∞)**: Sudden price movement to grab liquidity
- **Stop Hunt (üéØ)**: Price pushed to common stop loss levels then reverses
- **Fake Pump (üöÄ)**: Artificial pump to create FOMO
- **Fake Dump (üìâ)**: Artificial dump to create panic selling

### Elite Exit Strategy

The system includes sophisticated exit strategies that consider:

1. Fibonacci retracement levels
2. Reversal pattern detection
3. Trap probability signals
4. Market regime analysis
5. Dynamic trailing stops
6. Risk management thresholds

### Balance Management and Account Limits

The system uses improved balance checking logic that:

1. Uses **free balance** (available funds) rather than total balance for account limit checks
2. Properly handles different types of balances reported by BitGet API:
   - **Free Balance**: Funds available for new trades
   - **Used Balance**: Funds locked as margin/collateral
   - **Total Balance**: Includes all above plus unrealized P&L and notional position values
3. Supports setting a minimum free balance requirement with the `--min-free-balance` parameter
4. Provides clear logging about current balance status

## Installation and Setup

   - 1.618 ratio balance between abstraction layers
   - Phi-based proportionality in core components

## Development Guidelines

1. **Test Driven Development**
   - Maintain test coverage above 75%
   - Roll back if coverage decreases

2. **Module Refactoring**
   - Refactor classes exceeding 333 LoC
   - Consider AI efficiency in refactoring

3. **Process Management**
   - Kill running processes before starting new ones
   - Start system flow from scratch for clean state
   - Ensure logs are in place for debugging
   - Run in-scope processes in foreground for analysis

4. **Code Quality**
   - Use GNU license in all files
   - Document major project decisions via RFC READMEs
   - Preserve existing functionality when processing new features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Redis Connection Error**
   - Ensure Redis is running: `redis-cli ping`
   - Check connection parameters in `.env` file
   - Verify `REDIS_HOST` is set to `localhost` for local development

2. **BitGet API Issues**
   - Validate credentials using `verify_credentials.py`
   - Check API rate limits (BitGet has strict limits)
   - Ensure system clock is synchronized

3. **System Startup Issues**
   - Kill any running processes first: `pkill -f "python.*omega_ai"`
   - Start services in the correct order:
     1. Data feed
     2. WebSocket server
     3. MM trap consumer
     4. Trap probability meter
     5. Trap-aware traders

### Debugging Process

1. Check log files for specific errors
2. Run problematic components in foreground for direct observation
3. Use utility scripts to verify system state
4. Turn on DEBUG logging level for more verbose output
