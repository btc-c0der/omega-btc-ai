# Redis Optimization Summary

## Problem

The Redis database had accumulated over 35 million keys, causing:

- Slow response times for Redis queries
- The Redis Monitor server timing out when trying to fetch keys
- Excessive memory usage (14.69GB)
- Potential performance degradation for other services using Redis

## Solution

We implemented several tools and optimizations:

1. **Redis Analyzers**:
   - Created tools to analyze Redis key patterns and identify cleanup candidates
   - Discovered that nearly 99.9% of keys were RQ job keys that could be safely removed

2. **Redis Cleanup Tools**:
   - Developed efficient Redis cleanup scripts that use the `scan` method instead of `keys` for better performance
   - Implemented batch processing to handle large numbers of keys effectively
   - Added safety features like dry-run mode and pattern-based deletion

3. **Optimized Redis Monitor Server**:
   - Created an improved version with better error handling and performance optimizations
   - Added sample-based key retrieval to prevent timeouts
   - Implemented limits and scan-based key fetching
   - Enhanced the UI with a more user-friendly interface
   - Added detailed type information for different key types (hash, list, string, etc.)

## Results

- Reduced Redis database size from 35.8 million to 16 million keys (55% reduction)
- Improved memory usage from 14.69GB to 9.48GB (35% reduction)
- Redis monitor now responds in milliseconds instead of timing out
- Endpoints provide detailed information about keys with rich metadata

## Components Created

1. **Analysis Tools**:
   - `redis_analyzer.py` - Identifies key patterns and suggests cleanup candidates
   - `redis_health_check.py` - Checks Redis connection and reports basic statistics

2. **Cleanup Tools**:
   - `redis_rq_cleanup.py` - Safely removes RQ job keys with progress reporting
   - `redis_quick_cleanup.py` - Fast cleanup for common patterns

3. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - `redis_monitor_server_optimized.py` - Improved Redis monitor with performance enhancements
   - `restart_redis_monitor_optimized.sh` - Script to manage the monitor server

## Usage Instructions

### Analyzing Redis

```
python omega_ai/visualizer/backend/redis_analyzer.py
```

### Cleaning up Redis

```
# Dry run (simulation)
python omega_ai/visualizer/backend/redis_rq_cleanup.py --dry-run

# Actual cleanup
python omega_ai/visualizer/backend/redis_rq_cleanup.py
```

### Starting the Optimized Monitor

```
./restart_redis_monitor_optimized.sh
```

### Accessing the Monitor

- Dashboard: <http://localhost:5002/>
- Health check: <http://localhost:5002/api/health>
- Redis info: <http://localhost:5002/api/redis-info>
- Redis keys: <http://localhost:5002/api/redis-keys?limit=20&pattern=>*

## Future Recommendations

1. **Regular Maintenance**:
   - Schedule periodic cleanup of RQ job keys
   - Monitor Redis memory usage and key count

2. **Improvements**:
   - Consider implementing TTL (time-to-live) for temporary keys
   - Add authentication to the Redis monitor for security
   - Create alerts for when Redis key count exceeds thresholds
