## üî• CORE PHILOSOPHY

```
NO branches. ONE flow.
NO surprises. JUST tags.
NO chaos. ONLY prophecy.
```

The OMEGA DEV FRAMEWORK is not merely a development methodology; it's a **Living Dev Wisdom** that transforms conversations into code, code into tagged releases, failures into phoenix-like revivals, and tests into eternal truth.

## üß† DEFINING ELEMENTS

| Element                  | Meaning                                                   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zion_flow`              | The **mainline branch**. All blessed code grows here.     |
| Prompt-PY Immortalization | Every sacred convo ‚Üí a `.py` file ‚Üí versioned forever.    |
| `prompt_saver.py`        | The scribe. It keeps **our prophecies alive**.             |
| Tag-Driven Releases      | Tag it if it works. Revert to tag if it fails. Babylon-proof. |
| `TDD` Everywhere         | You write tests before code. Truth before manifestation.   |
| `OMEGA TDD ORACLE`       | Predicts missing tests before Babylon strikes. |
| `AI OMEGA Templates`     | Generate patterns with divine logic and cosmic standards.   |
| Canary Deployment        | Small rollout, divine observation, rollback if necessary.   |
| CI/CD + Terminal Outputs | Scripted, logged, and **divinely auditable**.             |

## üöÄ THE DIVINE FLOW

### 1. **Conversation to Code**

Every interaction is sacred and preserved. The framework ensures that knowledge flows seamlessly from conversation to implementation.

### 2. **Continuous Integration on the Sacred Path**

All code flows through the `zion_flow` branch, maintaining purity and integrity.

### 3. **Tag-Based Development**

Releases are marked with divine tags, allowing for:

- Clear versioning
- Easy rollback to stable states
- Babylon-proof development

### 4. **TDD as Divine Prophecy**

Tests are not afterthoughts but prophecies of functionality:

- Write the test to envision the future
- Implement code to fulfill the prophecy
- Verify the prophecy has manifested correctly

## üí° IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

### Setup Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/omega-btc-ai.git

# Switch to the zion_flow branch
git checkout zion_flow

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the integrated monitoring suite
./run_trap_position_monitors.sh
```

### Creating a New Feature

```bash
# Ensure you're on zion_flow
git checkout zion_flow

# Write tests first
python -m pytest test_new_feature.py -v

# Implement the feature
# ... divine coding happens here ...

# Create a tag when complete
git tag -a v0.4.3-feature_name -m "Divine feature manifested"
```

### Using the Prompt Saver

```bash
# Record a conversation
python prompt_saver.py --title "Divine_Trading_Algorithm" --save

# Retrieve a saved conversation
python prompt_saver.py --title "Divine_Trading_Algorithm" --load
```

---

## üåü THE OMEGA TDD ORACLE

The OMEGA TDD ORACLE provides divine guidance on test coverage:

- Predicts missing tests for your code
- Ensures full test coverage before deployment
- Prevents Babylon (bugs) from entering your sacred codebase

```bash
# Run the Oracle for guidance
python omega_tdd_oracle.py --scan-path ./omega_ai

# Apply the Oracle's recommendations
python omega_tdd_oracle.py --apply-recommendations
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è TOOLS OF THE DIVINE

### 1. **run_trap_position_monitors.sh**

Launches a dual-pane tmux session with:

- Position monitor in the top pane (RastaBitgetMonitor)
- Trap probability meter in the bottom pane

### 2. **prompt_saver.py**

The sacred scribe that preserves divine conversations.

### 3. **omega_tdd_oracle.py**

Prophetic testing guidance system.

### 4. **omega_watcher.py**

Divine guardian that watches your codebase and invokes the TDD Oracle when files are saved.

```bash
# Start the divine watcher
python omega_watcher.py --watch-dir ./your_codebase_dir

# Enable auto QA-tagging for successful test runs
python omega_watcher.py --watch-dir ./omega_ai --auto-tag

# The watcher automatically detects file changes,
# runs tests, and creates git tags for successful runs
# with format: vX.Y.Z-TDD-OMEGA-QA-APPROVED-testname-N
```

### 5. **RastaBitgetMonitor**

Divine position monitoring with Fibonacci-based insights.

### 6. **TrapProbabilityMeter**

Cosmic detection of market manipulation patterns.
