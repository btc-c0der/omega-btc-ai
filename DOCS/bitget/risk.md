**Explanation of Risk Management Module:**

1.  **`BitgetRiskManagedTrader` Class (Inheritance):**
    *   This new class `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` *inherits* from `BitgetTestnetAPI`. This means it automatically gets all the functionality of `BitgetTestnetAPI` (connection handling, order placement, closing positions, etc.).
    *   Inheritance is a key object-oriented programming concept that allows you to extend and reuse existing code, making your code more organized and efficient.

2.  **`__init__` Constructor (Extended):**
    *   The `__init__` constructor of `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` now takes additional risk management parameters:
        *   `risk_per_trade_percent`: Percentage of your account balance you are willing to risk on a single trade.
        *   `take_profit_multiplier`:  Determines how far your take-profit target is relative to your stop-loss distance (e.g., `2.0` means take profit is 2x as far as the stop loss).
        *   `stop_loss_percent`:  Percentage below your entry price to set your stop-loss.
    *   `super().__init__(...)`:  This line is crucial. It calls the `__init__` method of the *parent class* (`BitgetTestnetAPI`). This ensures that the base class is properly initialized (API credentials, API URL, etc.) before we add our risk management features.

3.  **`get_account_balance()` Method:**
    *   This new method retrieves your current account balance from the Bitget API.
    *   It makes an API call to the `/api/mix/v1/account/account` endpoint.
    *   It parses the JSON response and returns the `equity` (account balance).
    *   Error handling is included to print error messages if balance retrieval fails.

4.  **`calculate_position_size()` Method:**
    *   This method implements position sizing logic:
        *   It takes `entry_price`, `stop_loss_price`, `account_balance`, and `risk_percent` as input.
        *   It calculates the `risk_amount` (the actual dollar amount you are risking).
        *   It calculates `risk_per_unit` (the price difference between your entry and stop-loss).
        *   It then calculates the `position_size` (quantity in base currency) needed to achieve the desired `risk_amount` given the `risk_per_unit`.
        *   Includes input validation and error handling (e.g., for division by zero).

5.  **`place_limit_order_with_sl_tp()` Method:**
    *   This method is a *placeholder* and an *example* of how you *might* integrate stop-loss and take-profit consideration into your order placement.
    *   **Important:** As noted in the comments within this method, Bitget API might have more optimized ways to place orders with attached stop-loss and take-profit orders *in a single API call*.  **You should consult the Bitget API documentation for the most efficient and recommended approach for placing entry orders with SL/TP.**
    *   This example focuses on:
        *   Placing the *entry* limit order using `self.place_order()`.
        *   *Conceptually* demonstrating that you would *calculate* stop-loss and take-profit levels.
        *   **Emphasizing that in a real automated system, you would typically place SL/TP orders *after* the entry order is filled, often using separate market or limit orders triggered when price reaches SL/TP levels.**

6.  **`simple_trading_strategy()` Method:**
    *   This is a **very basic example** of a trading strategy. **It's not meant to be profitable in real trading.**
    *   It simply buys BTCUSDT if the current price is below $30,000 and sells if above $31,000.
    *   **You must replace this with your own, more sophisticated trading strategy.** This is just a placeholder to show where your strategy logic would go.

7.  **`execute_trading_logic()` Method:**
    *   This is the core method that brings everything together:
        *   **Gets Current Price:** Fetches the current price using an example ticker API call. **In a real system, you would use a reliable, real-time price feed.**
        *   **Gets Trading Signal:** Calls `self.trading_strategy()` to get a "buy", "sell", or "no action" signal based on the current price.
        *   **"Buy" Logic (Long Entry Example):**
            *   Retrieves account balance using `self.get_account_balance()`.
            *   Calculates `stop_loss_price` and `take_profit_price` based on `stop_loss_percent` and `take_profit_multiplier` relative to the entry price (current price in this example).
            *   Calculates `position_size` using `self.calculate_position_size()`, incorporating the `risk_per_trade_percent`.
            *   Prints calculated position size, stop-loss, and take-profit levels.
            *   Calls `self.place_limit_order_with_sl_tp()` to place a limit entry order (with the *conceptual* SL/TP levels - as explained earlier, actual automated SL/TP order placement might require further logic).
        *   **"Sell" Logic (Short Entry Placeholder):** Includes a placeholder for implementing short-selling logic (you would need to add code similar to the "buy" side to handle short positions).
        *   **"No Action" and Unknown Signal Handling:** Handles cases where the strategy signals no trade or returns an unexpected signal.

8.  **`_get_auth_headers()` Method:**
    *   This internal helper method is added to encapsulate the logic for creating authentication headers, making the code cleaner and more reusable within the `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` class. It's used by `get_account_balance` and could be used by other API-calling methods within this class.

9.  **Example Usage in `if __name__ == "__main__":`:**
    *   Initializes `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` with example risk management settings (`risk_per_trade_percent`, `take_profit_multiplier`, `stop_loss_percent`).
    *   Calls `risk_manager.execute_trading_logic()` to run the trading logic and risk management for the `BTCUSDT_UMCBL` symbol.
    *   Includes comments and a placeholder example for running the trading logic periodically in a loop (e.g., every 30 seconds).
    *   Provides important reminders to review and customize risk management settings and the trading strategy, and to always test thoroughly.

**To use this Risk Management module:**

1.  **Make sure you have the `BitgetTestnetAPI` class defined** (from the previous response).  If you haven't already, copy the `BitgetTestnetAPI` class code into the same Python file *before* the `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` class definition, or import it if you have saved it in a separate module.
2.  **Install `requests` library:** (if you haven't already)
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Set Bitget Testnet API Credentials as Environment Variables:** (as described in the previous response about Testnet testing).
4.  **Customize Risk Management Parameters:**
    *   Modify `risk_per_trade_percent`, `take_profit_multiplier`, `stop_loss_percent` when you initialize `BitgetRiskManagedTrader` in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to set your desired risk parameters.
5.  **Implement Your Trading Strategy:**
    *   **Crucially, replace the `simple_trading_strategy()` method with your own trading strategy logic.** The example strategy is very basic and not for real use. You need to develop and backtest your own strategy based on your trading style and market analysis.
6.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
    This will execute the trading logic with risk management, based on the `simple_trading_strategy` (which you should replace).

**Important Risk Management Reminders:**

*   **Risk Management is Essential:** This script provides a basic framework for risk management, but real-world trading requires much more sophisticated and robust risk management strategies.
*   **Customize Risk Parameters:** Carefully adjust `risk_per_trade_percent`, `take_profit_multiplier`, and `stop_loss_percent` to align with your risk tolerance and trading strategy.
*   **Trading Strategy is Key:**  The provided `simple_trading_strategy` is just a placeholder. You **must** develop and rigorously test your own trading strategy. Backtesting and forward testing are crucial to evaluate the effectiveness of your strategy.
*   **Stop-Loss Orders are Critical:** Stop-loss orders are a fundamental risk management tool. Ensure your strategy incorporates them to limit potential losses.
*   **Take-Profit Orders for Profit Securing:** Take-profit orders help you lock in profits when your price targets are reached.
*   **Test Thoroughly on Testnet:** **Always, always test your risk management settings and trading strategy extensively on the Bitget Testnet** before risking real funds on the mainnet.
*   **Disclaimer:** Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial financial risk. This script is for educational purposes and should not be considered financial or trading advice. Use it at your own risk.

This module provides a more comprehensive starting point for building a Bitget trading bot with basic risk management features. However, remember that this is still a simplified example, and real-world automated trading requires significant further development, testing, and risk management considerations.
