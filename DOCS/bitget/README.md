# BitGet Integration for OmegaBTC AI

This module provides integration with the BitGet cryptocurrency exchange for our trader profile system. It allows you to execute trades on BitGet while maintaining the psychological and risk management characteristics of different trader profiles.

## Features

- Integration with BitGet's testnet and mainnet APIs
- Support for all trader profiles (Strategic, Aggressive, Newbie, Scalper)
- Automatic position sizing and risk management
- Stop-loss and take-profit order management
- Trade history tracking and PnL calculation
- Psychological state tracking and adaptation

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. BitGet account (testnet or mainnet)
3. BitGet API credentials (API key, secret key, and passphrase)

## Installation

1. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests
```

2. Set up your BitGet API credentials as environment variables:

For testnet:

```bash
export BITGET_TESTNET_API_KEY="your_testnet_api_key"
export BITGET_TESTNET_SECRET_KEY="your_testnet_secret_key"
export BITGET_TESTNET_PASSPHRASE="your_testnet_passphrase"
```

For mainnet:

```bash
export BITGET_API_KEY="your_mainnet_api_key"
export BITGET_SECRET_KEY="your_mainnet_secret_key"
export BITGET_PASSPHRASE="your_mainnet_passphrase"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from omega_ai.trading.exchanges.bitget_trader import BitGetTrader

# Initialize a strategic trader
trader = BitGetTrader(
    profile_type="strategic",
    api_key="your_api_key",
    secret_key="your_secret_key",
    passphrase="your_passphrase",
    use_testnet=True,  # Use testnet for testing
    initial_capital=10000.0
)

# Create market context
market_context = {
    "price": 50000.0,  # Current BTC price
    "trend": "bullish",
    "volatility": 0.02,
    "volume": 1000000,
    "timestamp": datetime.now()
}

# Execute a trade
position = trader.execute_trade(market_context)

# Update positions with new price
trader.update_positions(51000.0)

# Get trade history
history = trader.get_trade_history()

# Get total PnL
total_pnl = trader.get_total_pnl()
```
