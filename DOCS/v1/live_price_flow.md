I'll help you verify that all components are properly using live BTC data. Let me analyze the data flow and connections.

First, let me check how the live BTC data is being fed into the system:

Let me analyze how the live BTC data flows through the system:

1. **Data Source**: The system gets live BTC data from Binance WebSocket API (`wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@trade`)

2. **Data Flow**:
   - The `btc_live_feed.py` receives price updates via WebSocket
   - Each price update is:
     - Stored in Redis (`last_btc_price`, `btc_movement_history`)
     - Saved to PostgreSQL database
     - Sent to MM WebSocket server (port 8766)

3. **Components Using Live Data**:
   - Market Trends Monitor (`monitor_market_trends.py`)
   - Trap Probability Meter (`trap_probability_meter.py`)
   - Fibonacci Detector
   - High Frequency Detector

Let me check how each component accesses the live data:

After analyzing the code, I can confirm that all components are indeed using live BTC data. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Data Source**:
   - Live BTC price data comes from Binance WebSocket API
   - The `btc_live_feed.py` module handles the WebSocket connection and data ingestion

2. **Data Storage**:
   - Prices are stored in Redis with multiple keys:
     - `last_btc_price`: Current price
     - `btc_movement_history`: Price history
     - `btc_movements_{timeframe}min`: Timeframe-specific price history
     - `last_btc_update_time`: Timestamp of last update

3. **Components Using Live Data**:

   a. **Market Trends Monitor**:
   - Uses `fetch_multi_interval_movements()` to get price data from Redis
   - Validates price ranges (50k-100k for BTC)
   - Updates every minute with real-time data

   b. **Trap Detection**:
   - `TrapProbabilityMeter` gets current price from Redis
   - `HighFrequencyDetector` uses live price for trap registration
   - All trap detections include current price validation

   c. **Fibonacci Analysis**:
   - Uses `get_recent_price_data()` to fetch live price data from Redis
   - Calculates levels based on recent price movements
   - Updates dynamically with price changes

   d. **Trading Components**:
   - `ProfiledFuturesTrader` gets live price via `update_current_price()`
   - `TradingAnalyzer` uses real-time price for market context
   - All trading decisions are based on live data

4. **Health Monitoring**:
   - `health_check.py` verifies that:
     - BTC live feed process is running
     - Redis is being updated with new prices
     - Data is not stale (checks last update time)
     - Price data is valid

5. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Components have proper error handling for Redis connection issues
   - Fallback values are used only when live data is unavailable
   - Health checks alert when data becomes stale
