I've created a complete solution for your continuous MM trap simulation:

1. **Standalone Simulation Service (`trap_simulation_service.py`)**:
   - Completely self-contained with all necessary functionality
   - Uses real BTC price from Redis as starting point
   - Configurable volatility and trap frequency
   - Simulates different market regimes and trends
   - Stores all simulation data in Redis with `sim_` prefix
   - Detailed console output with color-coding
   - High-frequency mode detection based on trap patterns

2. **Systemd Service File (`mm_trap_simulator.service`)**:
   - For running as a system service on Linux systems
   - Auto-restart capabilities
   - Security hardening with process isolation
   - Dependency management (requires Redis)

3. **Daemon Shell Script (`run_simulator_daemon.sh`)**:
   - For systems without systemd or for development
   - Simple start/stop/restart/status commands
   - Process management with PID tracking
   - Log file management
   - Graceful shutdown handling

To use the simulation service:

1. **Direct execution**:

   ```
   python -m omega_ai.mm_trap_detector.trap_simulation_service --volatility 1.5 --frequency 0.3
   ```

2. **As a daemon (Unix/Linux/macOS)**:

   ```
   ./omega_ai/mm_trap_detector/run_simulator_daemon.sh start
   ./omega_ai/mm_trap_detector/run_simulator_daemon.sh status
   ./omega_ai/mm_trap_detector/run_simulator_daemon.sh stop
   ```

3. **As a systemd service (Linux)**:

   ```
   # Edit the service file to set your correct paths
   sudo cp omega_ai/mm_trap_detector/mm_trap_simulator.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable mm_trap_simulator
   sudo systemctl start mm_trap_simulator
   ```

This gives you a complete solution for running continuous market maker trap simulations. All data is stored in Redis with the `sim_` prefix to avoid interfering with real data.
