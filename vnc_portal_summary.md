## Overview

The OMEGA VNC Portal is a comprehensive solution for accessing remote VNC servers securely through a web browser. This portal bridges the gap between traditional VNC servers and modern web-based access, allowing users to connect to their remote machines without installing any VNC client software.

## Component Architecture

The OMEGA VNC Portal consists of the following core components:

1. **Core Python Script (omega_vnc_portal.py)**
   - Manages Docker containers
   - Handles web-to-VNC connection forwarding
   - Provides command-line interface for all operations

2. **Custom Docker Image (Dockerfile.omega-vnc)**
   - Based on the noVNC project
   - Customized with OMEGA BTC AI branding
   - Pre-configured for optimal performance and security

3. **Control Panel (run_vnc_portal.sh)**
   - Interactive menu system
   - Simplifies access to all VNC portal operations
   - User-friendly interface for all portal functionality

4. **Build System (build_omega_vnc_image.sh)**
   - Automates Docker image creation
   - Ensures consistent build environment
   - Supports customization options

5. **Test Suite (test_omega_vnc.sh)**
   - Validates all portal functions
   - Ensures proper Docker integration
   - Verifies web accessibility

6. **Cloud Deployment (setup_scaleway_vnc.sh)**
   - Provisions cloud infrastructure
   - Configures SSL for secure connections
   - Sets up reverse proxy for public access

## Deployment Options

### Local Deployment

```bash
# Simple startup with default settings
./omega_vnc_portal.py

# Advanced startup with custom settings
./omega_vnc_portal.py --port 8080 --vnc-target other-machine:5900
```

### Cloud Deployment

```bash
# Scaleway cloud setup with SSL
sudo ./setup_scaleway_vnc.sh --mac-ip 123.456.789.0 --domain vnc.example.com

# Scaleway cloud setup without SSL
sudo ./setup_scaleway_vnc.sh --mac-ip 123.456.789.0 --no-ssl
```
