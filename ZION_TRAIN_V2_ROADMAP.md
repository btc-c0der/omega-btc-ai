# OMEGA BTC AI - ZION TRAIN V2 ROADMAP

## Overview

This document serves as the primary reference for the ZION TRAIN V2 release of OMEGA BTC AI. It outlines our technical roadmap, development guidelines, and best practices for AI-assisted development.

## {{{{ OMEGA DISCLAIMER }}}}

- TDD is the first very rule, we breath Test Driven Development
  - Test coverage higher than 75% is superb.
  - in case the coverage reduces, we rollback and check why
- When a class LoC is above 333, we apply a modules refactoring should be done in considering AI efficiency
- Important that we revise that previous functionality is not being overwritten while processing a prompt, as a different AI model could have been working on previous code :)
- Before spawning processes, please make sure to kill all running ones, start the whole system flow from scratch, make sure logs are in place for tail and debug, and run the in-scope process on foreground for analysis.
- Log critical major project decisions and refactor via RFC READMEs
- Insert on all files the GNU license

## V2 Technical Roadmap

## Best Practices for AI Development

### AI-Assisted Workflow

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Be specific about context and requirements
   - Provide relevant file snippets for reference
   - Specify exact locations for code changes

2. **Code Review**
   - Always review AI-generated code for logical consistency
   - Check for inadvertent overwrites of existing functionality
   - Verify type safety and error handling

3. **Iterative Development**
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, focused prompts
   - Build incrementally with testing at each stage
   - Use AI for both implementation and testing

### Divine Flow Principles

1. **Harmonic Development**
   - Align code structure with natural patterns of complexity
   - Use consistent abstractions across the codebase
   - Balance flexibility with simplicity

2. **Assembly Fibonacci**
   - Structure component relationships following Fibonacci sequence patterns
   - Modules should follow natural scaling proportions
   - Apply recursive patterns of abstraction

3. **Golden Ratio Architecture**
   - Apply 1.618 ratio to balance between abstraction layers
   - Core components should exhibit phi-based proportionality
   - Use golden ratio for UI element sizing and spacing

## Debugging & Troubleshooting

### System Observation

1. **Logging Strategy**
   - Use hierarchical logging with appropriate levels
   - Include context information in log entries
   - Implement color coding for different severity levels

2. **Process Management**
   - Always clean up processes before starting new ones
   - Use foreground execution for debugging
   - Maintain a controlled startup sequence

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track execution time for critical operations
   - Monitor memory usage patterns
   - Identify and address bottlenecks

### Troubleshooting Workflow

1. **Issue Identification**
   - Capture and analyze logs
   - Reproduce in isolated environment
   - Identify patterns and triggers

2. **Solution Implementation**
   - Write tests that reproduce the issue
   - Implement fixes with proper error handling
   - Verify solution doesn't impact other functionality

3. **Validation**
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Verify performance metrics
   - Conduct integration testing

## Development Process

### Code Management

1. **Branch Strategy**
   - Feature branches from main development branch
   - Pull requests with code reviews
   - Regular merging to avoid divergence

2. **Documentation**
   - RFC documents for major architectural changes
   - Inline documentation for complex algorithms
   - API documentation for all public interfaces

3. **Licensing**
   - Ensure all files include GNU license header
   - Track third-party dependencies and their licenses
   - Maintain license compatibility

### Continuous Improvement

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Track code quality metrics
   - Monitor test coverage
   - Measure performance indicators

2. **Refactoring Triggers**
   - Class size exceeding 333 LoC
   - Cyclomatic complexity thresholds
   - Duplicate code detection

3. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Create pattern libraries
   - Build shared understanding of system architecture
