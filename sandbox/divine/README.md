# OMEGA BTC AI - Divine Alignment Dashboard v2

> "This assembly is not mechanicalâ€”it's rhythmic. Let's tune it as if each opcode had intention."

The Divine Alignment Dashboard is a visualization and analysis tool that provides insights into Bitcoin's price movements based on golden ratio and Fibonacci principles, now enhanced with trader personas that embody different trading strategies.

## Features

- **Golden Ratio Visualization**: View Bitcoin price charts with golden ratio and Fibonacci overlays
- **Divine Alignment Analysis**: Track how closely BTC price aligns with golden ratio levels
- **Fibonacci Crossing Detection**: Get alerts when price crosses significant Fibonacci levels
- **Trade Recommendations**: Receive trade signals based on golden ratio alignment
- **Market Data Analysis**: See key support/resistance levels and momentum indicators
- **Trader Personas**: Understand different trading strategies through personified traders
- **Performance Metrics**: Track win rates, profits, and drawdown for each trader persona

## New in v2: Trader Personas

The dashboard now features four distinct trader personas, each with their own personality, trading style, and performance characteristics:

1. **Strategic Trader** - Methodical and disciplined with a focus on Fibonacci levels
2. **Aggressive Trader** - Bold and decisive, seeking high-leverage opportunities
3. **Scalper Trader** - Quick and nimble, exploiting small golden ratio divergences
4. **Divine Harmonizer** - Intuitive and balanced, seeking universal alignment across markets

Each persona provides a unique lens through which to view market movements and potential trading strategies.
