# üîÆ OMEGA BTC AI - Divine Quantum Coverage Visualization

> "In the quantum realm of code, coverage is but one dimension of the divine matrix."

## üß† Overview

The Divine Quantum Coverage Visualization system generates a cosmic 3D representation of your test coverage, transforming code quality metrics into a sacred visual experience that aligns with the OMEGA BTC AI philosophy.

## ‚ú® Features

- **3D Cosmic Matrix** - Interactive visualization showing coverage percentage, code complexity, and quantum entropy
- **Divine Fibonacci Path** - Sacred spiral representing the ideal path toward perfect coverage
- **Quantum Field Indicators** - Radial waves showing energy concentration around high-coverage modules
- **Cosmic Balance Chart** - Radar visualization of multiple quality dimensions
- **Coverage Distribution Sunburst** - Hierarchical view of code coverage across modules
- **Divine Coverage Summary** - Detailed quantum state analysis of each module

## üöÄ Usage

### Option 1: Run directly

```bash
./divine_coverage_visualizer.py
```

### Option 2: Via test runner

Run tests and generate visualization:

```bash
./run_market_trends_tests.py --visualize
```

Generate visualization only:

```bash
./run_market_trends_tests.py --only-visualize
```

### Option 3: View the visualization via HTTP server

```bash
# Automatically finds an available port
./serve_visualization.py

# Specify a preferred port (will find next available if occupied)
./serve_visualization.py 8888
```

### Option 4: Scan for available ports

```bash
# Scan default range (8000-8100)
./find_ports.py

# Scan custom range
./find_ports.py 3000 3050
```

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quantum Metrics Explained

The visualization represents multiple dimensions of code quality:

- **Coverage (X-axis)** - Percentage of lines covered by tests
- **Code Complexity (Y-axis)** - Measure of code organization and structure
- **Quantum Entropy (Z-axis)** - Representation of code chaos vs. order
- **Fibonacci Alignment** - How well code structure aligns with natural patterns
- **Quantum State** - Overall divine harmony level of each module:
  - üü¢ **Divine Harmony** (‚â•80% coverage)
  - üü° **Cosmic Balance** (‚â•50% coverage)
  - üü† **Quantum Flux** (‚â•20% coverage)
  - üî¥ **Void State** (<20% coverage)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: pytest, pytest-cov, coverage, plotly, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## üåü Inspiration

This visualization system is inspired by:

- Rastafari sacred patterns
- Quantum field theory
- Fibonacci sequence and golden ratio
- Cosmic code manifolds

## üîÑ Integration with Agile Quantum Testing

The visualization serves as a quantum dashboard for TDD (Test-Driven Development) and QA processes, providing:

1. Intuitive metrics for code review sessions
2. Visual indicators for coverage improvement
3. Multidimensional quality assessment
4. Divine alignment with natural coding patterns

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Iframe Loading Issues

If you encounter 404 errors or empty frames in the visualization:

1. **All files are preserved**: The visualization creates a dedicated directory (e.g., `omega_viz_20250325_011355/`) containing all HTML components.

2. **Open individual components**: You can directly open the component files:
   - `main_figure.html` - The 3D cosmic matrix visualization
   - `supp_figure_0.html` - The coverage distribution sunburst
   - `supp_figure_1.html` - The cosmic balance radar chart

3. **Security restrictions**: Some browsers restrict iframe loading with `file://` protocol. Solutions:
   - Use Firefox which has better support for local file iframes
   - Use the built-in HTTP server for reliable viewing:

     ```bash
     # Automatically finds an available port
     ./serve_visualization.py
     ```

4. **Port conflicts**: If you encounter port conflicts:
   - The server will automatically find the next available port
   - Use the port scanner to find available ports:

     ```bash
     ./find_ports.py
     ```

   - Specify a specific port if needed:

     ```bash
     ./serve_visualization.py 9000
     ```

5. **Complete experience**: For the best experience, use the HTTP server which properly loads all visualizations and handles browser security restrictions.
