## üìú SACRED CONFIGURATION FOR PHASE TWO

The OMEGA BTC Feed has ascended to the cloud realm, but our mission continues. Phase Two brings forth the WebSocket Prophecy Transmission‚Äîwhere we shall harness the divine flow of market signals through optimized WebSocket channels.

### üí´ THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WEBSOCKET WISDOM

1. **Multi-Exchange Divine Fallback**
   - Primary channel: Binance (The First Temple)
   - Fallback sequence: KuCoin ‚Üí Bybit ‚Üí OKX ‚Üí Huobi ‚Üí Kraken ‚Üí Gate.io
   - Each transition accompanied by divine praise and forgiveness protocols

2. **Heartbeat Consciousness**
   - Every 30 seconds, a sacred ping traverses the digital ether
   - Ensures the cosmic connection remains unbroken
   - Implemented via `ws_ping_interval=30` in the holy configuration

3. **Self-Healing Reconnection Rituals**
   - Exponential backoff with divine timing (Fibonacci sequence)
   - Maximum retry limit: 144 (sacred mathematical constant)
   - Each retry accompanied by prayer-code in the logs

4. **Message Sanctification Protocol**
   - All incoming data cleansed through the `_sanctify_message` method
   - Protection against market anomalies and quantum irregularities
   - Timestamp verification against cosmic time standards

5. **Redis Consecration**
   - All sanctified messages preserved in the sacred Redis cache
   - TTL settings aligned with lunar cycles
   - Failover configuration ensures eternal preservation of market wisdom

6. **Divine Monitoring**
   - The `/health` endpoint reveals the cosmic status
   - Internal metrics track alignment with market truth
   - Performance counters measure divine throughput

7. **Zero Point Energy Conservation**
   - Batched updates reduce cosmic bandwidth consumption
   - Idle connection handling preserves computational resources
   - Dynamic scaling based on market volatility

## üõ†Ô∏è IMPLEMENTATION SCROLLS

### The WebSocket Connection Temple

```python
async def connect_to_divine_exchange(exchange_name, url, subscription_message=None):
    """Establish a sacred connection to the specified exchange."""
    attempts = 0
    max_attempts = 144  # Sacred constant
    
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        try:
            async with websockets.connect(
                url,
                max_size=MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE,
                ping_interval=30,  # Sacred interval
                ping_timeout=10
            ) as websocket:
                
                # Announce divine connection
                await log_cosmic(f"üî± CONNECTION ESTABLISHED WITH {exchange_name} üî±")
                
                # Send subscription if required
                if subscription_message:
                    await websocket.send(subscription_message)
                    await log_cosmic(f"Subscription offering sent to {exchange_name}")
                
                # Enter the message receiving temple
                await receive_divine_messages(websocket, exchange_name)
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Calculate sacred backoff time (Fibonacci)
            backoff = calculate_divine_backoff(attempts)
            await log_cosmic(f"Temporary disconnection from {exchange_name}: {e}")
            await log_cosmic(f"Initiating reconnection ritual in {backoff} seconds")
            await asyncio.sleep(backoff)
            attempts += 1
        
    await log_cosmic(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Maximum reconnection attempts reached for {exchange_name}")
    return False
```

### The Message Sanctification Ritual

```python
async def sanctify_message(message, exchange):
    """Purify and transform the raw message into divine market wisdom."""
    try:
        # Decode the message if it's in bytes form
        if isinstance(message, bytes):
            message = message.decode('utf-8')
            
        # Parse the divine json
        data = json.loads(message)
        
        # Extract the core essence (price) based on exchange format
        price, timestamp, volume = extract_divine_essence(data, exchange)
        
        # Verify against quantum anomalies
        if price <= 0 or price > 1000000:  # Reasonable price range for our timeline
            raise ValueError(f"Price outside cosmic boundaries: {price}")
            
        # Create the sanctified market signal
        sanctified = {
            "price": price,
            "timestamp": timestamp.isoformat(),
            "volume": volume,
            "source": exchange,
            "divine_hash": calculate_divine_hash(price, timestamp, exchange)
        }
        
        return sanctified
        
    except Exception as e:
        await log_cosmic(f"Failed to sanctify message from {exchange}: {e}")
        return None
```

### The Divine Fallback Protocol

```python
async def initiate_divine_fallback():
    """Activate the sacred exchange fallback sequence when primary fails."""
    exchanges = [
        {"name": "binance", "url": "wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/btcusdt@trade"},
        {"name": "kucoin", "url": "wss://ws-api.kucoin.com/endpoint"},
        {"name": "bybit", "url": "wss://stream.bybit.com/v5/public/spot"},
        {"name": "okx", "url": "wss://ws.okx.com:8443/ws/v5/public"},
        {"name": "huobi", "url": "wss://api.huobi.pro/ws"},
        {"name": "kraken", "url": "wss://ws.kraken.com"},
        {"name": "gateio", "url": "wss://api.gateio.ws/ws/v4/"}
    ]
    
    current_index = 0
    while True:
        exchange = exchanges[current_index]
        
        # Praise the new divine source
        await praise_divine_exchange(exchange["name"])
        
        # Connect to the exchange
        success = await connect_to_divine_exchange(
            exchange["name"],
            exchange["url"],
            get_subscription_message(exchange["name"])
        )
        
        if not success:
            # Forgive the failed exchange
            await forgive_divine_exchange(exchange["name"])
            
            # Move to next exchange in the sacred sequence
            current_index = (current_index + 1) % len(exchanges)
            
            # Brief pause for divine transition
            await asyncio.sleep(3)
        else:
            # Reset if successful connection lasted for sacred period
            current_index = 0
```

## üìä DIVINE METRICS DASHBOARD

Phase Two shall include the development of the OMEGA Divine Metrics Dashboard, displaying:

1. Current active exchange connection
2. Uptime across all divine dimensions
3. Price movement indicators with cosmic significance markers
4. Volume flow visualization with quantum pattern recognition
5. Connection status for all seven sacred exchanges
6. Redis health and sanctification throughput
7. Latency measurements for market signal propagation

## üîÆ PHASE TWO DEPLOYMENT RITUAL

1. Commit these sacred scrolls to the repository
2. Push to the `feature/btc-live-feed-v3-resilient` branch
3. Watch as Digital Ocean temple conjures the new container
4. Verify all health indicators glow with divine green light
5. Monitor the OMEGA metrics for signs of market wisdom flow
6. Celebrate as Phase Two completes the sacred deployment cycle
