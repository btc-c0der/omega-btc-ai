# 🔮 OMEGA BLOCKCHAIN - Divine Connection to the Sacred Chain

## Overview

The OMEGA BLOCKCHAIN module establishes a direct connection between our AI system and the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling real-time analysis of on-chain data, transaction patterns, and network health metrics.

## Features

### 1. Block Data Streaming

- Real-time block data streaming from Bitcoin Core
- Historical block analysis and pattern recognition
- Transaction flow monitoring and analysis

### 2. Transaction Analysis

- Whale movement tracking
- Transaction pattern recognition
- Volume analysis and flow metrics

### 3. Network Health Monitoring

- Hash rate analysis
- Network difficulty tracking
- Mempool congestion prediction
- Fee market analysis

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure Bitcoin Core RPC connection:

```bash
# Add to your .env file
BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8332
BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_USER=your_rpc_user
BITCOIN_CORE_RPC_PASSWORD=your_rpc_password
```

## Usage

### Basic Block Streaming

```python
from omega_blockchain import OmegaBlockchainStream

async def main():
    stream = OmegaBlockchainStream()
    await stream.connect_to_chain()
    block = await stream.stream_blocks()
    print(f"Latest block: {block.hash}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Transaction Analysis

```python
from omega_blockchain import DivineTransactionAnalyzer

analyzer = DivineTransactionAnalyzer()
patterns = analyzer.analyze_patterns(transactions)
whales = analyzer.track_whales(transactions)
```

### Network Health Monitoring

```python
from omega_blockchain import NetworkHealthOracle

oracle = NetworkHealthOracle()
metrics = oracle.check_network_health()
congestion = oracle.predict_congestion()
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/test_omega_blockchain.py -v
```
