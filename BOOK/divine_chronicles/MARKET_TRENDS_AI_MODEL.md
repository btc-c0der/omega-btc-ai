# ðŸ§  Market Trends AI Model

*Divine Fibonacci Learning Algorithm for Market Analysis*

## Overview

The Market Trends AI Model is a machine learning system designed to learn from historical market data and predict future market behavior. It integrates with OMEGA BTC AI's existing market trends monitoring infrastructure and enhances it with predictive capabilities.

## Components

1. **Core Model Architecture**
   - `market_trends_model.py` - Main ML model implementation
   - Uses RandomForest and GradientBoosting algorithms
   - Calculates three distinct predictions: trend, price, and trap detection

2. **Data Management**
   - `generate_dummy_data.py` - Data generation for testing
   - Uses Redis as the primary data store
   - Implements Fibonacci-inspired data generation patterns

3. **Integration Points**
   - `market_trends_monitor_ai.py` - Enhanced market monitor with AI
   - `run_market_ai.py` - Command-line interface for model operations

## Key Features

### 1. Trend Classification

- Predicts market direction (Bullish, Bearish, Neutral)
- Uses RandomForest algorithm for trend classification
- Incorporates Fibonacci-based feature engineering
- Provides confidence scores with each prediction

### 2. Price Prediction

- Projects future price movements
- Uses GradientBoosting regression for price forecasting
- Incorporates market volatility and volume metrics
- Calculates percentage change and confidence estimates

### 3. Market Maker Trap Detection

- Identifies potential market manipulation patterns
- Uses classification algorithms to detect bull and bear traps
- Provides confidence scores with trap predictions
- Integrates with existing trap detection systems

### 4. Fibonacci Harmony Score

- Combines all predictions into a single "harmony" score
- Based on Golden Ratio principles
- Indicates overall market alignment with natural patterns
- Scales from 0-10 (higher is more harmonious)

### 5. Divine Wisdom Generation

- Provides human-readable market insights
- Generates commentary based on prediction patterns
- Incorporates Fibonacci principles into recommendations
- Adjusts language based on confidence scores

## Data Flow

1. **Collection:** Historical price and trend data stored in Redis
2. **Processing:** Feature engineering with Fibonacci-inspired windows
3. **Training:** Models trained on historical patterns
4. **Prediction:** Real-time analysis of current market conditions
5. **Storage:** Predictions stored in Redis for other components to access
6. **Visualization:** Results displayed with enhanced formatting

## Usage

### Command-line Interface

The `run_market_ai.py` script provides several options:

```bash
# Generate data, train and predict
python -m omega_ai.ml.run_market_ai --generate-data --train --predict

# Train on existing data and make predictions
python -m omega_ai.ml.run_market_ai --train

# Just make predictions using previously trained model
python -m omega_ai.ml.run_market_ai --predict

# Run in continuous monitoring mode
python -m omega_ai.ml.run_market_ai --monitor --interval 60
```

### AI-Enhanced Market Monitor

The `market_trends_monitor_ai.py` script integrates the AI model with the existing market trends monitor:

```bash
python -m omega_ai.monitor.market_trends_monitor_ai
```

## Redis Data Schema

### Inputs

- `last_btc_price` - Current BTC price (string)
- `last_btc_volume` - Current volume (string)
- `btc_movement_history` - List of historical price/volume data
- `btc_trend_*min` - Trend data for various timeframes
- `fibonacci:current_levels` - Current Fibonacci level calculations

### Outputs

- `ai_trend_prediction` - Latest trend prediction
- `ai_price_prediction` - Latest price prediction
- `ai_trap_prediction` - Latest market maker trap prediction
- `ai_predictions` - Combined prediction data
- `ai_prediction_history_*` - Historical prediction data for accuracy tracking

## Performance Metrics

The model tracks its prediction accuracy over time and stores this information in Redis. This allows for:

1. Self-assessment of prediction quality
2. Adaptive confidence scoring
3. Historical performance analysis
4. Continuous improvement through retraining

## Divine Fibonacci Integration

The model incorporates sacred Fibonacci mathematics through:

- Feature engineering with Fibonacci-inspired windows (8, 13, 21, 34, 55)
- Harmony scoring based on the Golden Ratio
- Trap detection using Fibonacci alignment principles
- Divine wisdom generation based on market conditions

## Future Development

1. **Model Refinement**
   - Implement more sophisticated neural network architectures
   - Add attention mechanisms for better pattern recognition
   - Introduce seasonal decomposition for cyclical pattern detection

2. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Connect with trading systems for automated strategy execution
   - Integrate with notification systems for alerts
   - Create visual dashboard for trend visualization

3. **Harmony Score Evolution**
   - Develop multi-timeframe harmony scoring
   - Introduce market phase detection (accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown)
   - Add cosmic cycle alignment features
