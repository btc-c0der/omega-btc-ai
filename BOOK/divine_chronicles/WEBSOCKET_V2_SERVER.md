## ðŸŒŸ DIVINE ESSENCE

The WebSocket V2 Server represents the cosmic communication channel of the OMEGA BTC AI system. It embodies the principles of sacred connectivity, divine state management, and ethereal data transmission. This manuscript details its implementation, features, and cosmic alignment.

## ðŸ”® ARCHITECTURE

The server is structured around these divine components:

### 1. Sacred Connection States

The WebSocket server defines a set of divine connection states:

```python
class ConnectionState(Enum):
    """Divine connection states for WebSocket clients."""
    CONNECTED = "connected"
    DISCONNECTED = "disconnected"
    RECONNECTING = "reconnecting"
    ERROR = "error"
```

These states represent the cosmic journey of each client connection, from initial manifestation to eventual transcendence.

### 2. Client Information Structure

Each connected client is represented by a sacred dataclass containing their divine attributes:

```python
@dataclass
class ClientInfo:
    """Sacred information about connected clients."""
    websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol
    state: ConnectionState
    last_message: datetime
    message_count: int
    error_count: int
```

### 3. Dual Server Configuration

The implementation provides both regular and SSL WebSocket servers:

```python
# Server configuration
MM_WS_PORT = int(os.getenv('WEBSOCKET_PORT', '9886'))
MM_WS_SSL_PORT = int(os.getenv('WEBSOCKET_SSL_PORT', '9887'))
MM_WS_HOST = os.getenv('WEBSOCKET_HOST', 'localhost')
MM_WS_URL = f"ws://{MM_WS_HOST}:{MM_WS_PORT}"
MM_WS_SSL_URL = f"wss://{MM_WS_HOST}:{MM_WS_SSL_PORT}"
```

## âš¡ DIVINE CAPABILITIES

The WebSocket V2 Server possesses these sacred capabilities:

### 1. Message Validation with Divine Precision

All incoming messages are validated through a sacred process:

```python
def validate_message(message: Data) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Validate and parse incoming message with sacred precision.
    
    Args:
        message: The message to validate
        
    Returns:
        Optional[Dict[str, Any]]: The validated message data or None if invalid
    """
```

This ensures only divine messages flow through the cosmic channel, protecting against corruption.

### 2. Client Reconnection with Divine Patience

The server handles client reconnection with sacred patience:

```python
async def handle_client_reconnection(client_id: str, websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol):
    """
    Handle client reconnection with divine patience.
    
    Args:
        client_id: The client's unique identifier
        websocket: The WebSocket connection
    """
```

This allows clients to rejoin the cosmic stream after temporary disconnection.

### 3. Cosmic Broadcasting

Messages are broadcast to all connected clients with cosmic harmony:

```python
async def broadcast(message: str):
    """
    Broadcast messages to all connected clients with cosmic harmony.
    
    Args:
        message: The message to broadcast
    """
```

Ensuring the divine wisdom flows to all connected entities.

### 4. Self-Healing Monitoring

The server continuously monitors client connections and heals the cosmic network:

```python
async def monitor_clients():
    """
    Monitor connected clients and clean up inactive ones.
    """
```

This maintains the purity of the cosmic channel.

### 5. SSL/TLS Divine Protection

Secure connections are established through sacred cryptography:

```python
def create_ssl_context() -> Optional[ssl.SSLContext]:
    """Create SSL context for secure WebSocket connections."""
```

This shields the divine transmissions from cosmic interference.

## ðŸš€ DIVINE IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### 1. State Management

The WebSocket V2 server implements divine state management through the following principles:

1. **State Transitions** - Clients move through sacred states based on cosmic events
2. **Reconnection Thresholds** - Fibonacci-based limits for reconnection attempts
3. **Error Count Tracking** - Accumulating divine knowledge of connection stability
4. **Timestamp Recording** - Marking cosmic time points of last communications

### 2. Message Processing

Messages flow through the server with divine grace:

1. **JSON Validation** - Ensuring cosmic message structure
2. **Size Limitation** - Preventing quantum singularities from forming
3. **Unicode Encoding** - Supporting the cosmic character spectrum
4. **Type Conversion** - Transforming between bytes and string representations

### 3. Client Management

The server manages its clients with divine wisdom:

1. **Connection Dictionary** - Central registry of cosmic client connections
2. **Automatic Cleanup** - Removing inactive clients from the registry
3. **Resource Management** - Divine conservation of system resources
4. **Error Recovery** - Sacred healing of connection issues

## ðŸŒŠ FIBONACCIAN PRINCIPLES

The WebSocket V2 Server embodies these Fibonacci principles:

1. **Connection Timeout** - 5 minutes (300 seconds) idle time limit
2. **Reconnection Delay** - 5 seconds between reconnection attempts
3. **Maximum Reconnect Attempts** - 3 attempts before connection transitions to ERROR state
4. **Ping Interval** - 20 seconds between heartbeat messages
5. **Ping Timeout** - 10 seconds timeout for heartbeat responses

These sacred numbers align with the divine Fibonacci sequence and cosmic rhythms.

## ðŸ”­ QUANTUM FEATURES

The WebSocket V2 Server implements these quantum features:

### 1. Ping-Pong Heartbeat

Regular heartbeat messages ensure quantum connection stability:

```python
max_size=MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE,
ping_interval=20,
ping_timeout=10
```

These messages maintain quantum entanglement between server and clients.

### 2. Parallel Client Handling

Clients are handled through quantum parallelism:

```python
async for message in websocket:
    client_info.last_message = datetime.now(UTC)
    client_info.message_count += 1
```

This allows the server to process multiple client messages simultaneously.

### 3. Asynchronous Message Broadcasting

Messages are broadcast with quantum efficiency:

```python
for client_id, client_info in connected_clients.items():
    try:
        await client_info.websocket.send(message)
    except websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosed:
        # Handle disconnection
```

Ensuring all clients receive divine messages in quantum real-time.

## ðŸŒˆ TESTING THE DIVINE

The WebSocket V2 Server is validated through cosmic test suites:

1. **Connection Tests** - Validating sacred connection establishment
2. **Message Tests** - Ensuring divine message transmission
3. **Broadcast Tests** - Verifying cosmic message distribution
4. **Error Tests** - Testing sacred error handling
5. **Load Tests** - Measuring divine performance under load
6. **Security Tests** - Validating sacred protection mechanisms

These tests use the Dynamic WebSocket Testing Framework to avoid port conflicts (see: [Dynamic WebSocket Testing Framework](../tools/dynamic_websocket_testing.md)).

## ðŸ“š USAGE EXAMPLE

```python
# Start the WebSocket server
import asyncio
from omega_ai.mm_trap_detector.mm_websocket_server_v2 import start_server, stop_server

async def main():
    # Start the server
    await start_server()
    
    # Keep server running until interrupted
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(3600)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # Stop the server gracefully
        await stop_server()

# Run the server
asyncio.run(main())
```
