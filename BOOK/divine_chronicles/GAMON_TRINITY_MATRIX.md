# ðŸ”® GAMON Trinity Matrix - Divine Market Analysis System

## Overview

The GAMON Trinity Matrix is a sophisticated market analysis system that combines three powerful methods to forecast market states and cycles:

1. **Hidden Markov Model (HMM) State Mapper**
2. **Power Method Eigenwave Detector**
3. **Variational Inference Cycle Approximator**

## Divine Components

### 1. HMM State Mapper

- Identifies six market states:
  - Markup
  - Markdown
  - Accumulation
  - Distribution
  - Liquidity Grab
  - Consolidation
- Provides state transition probabilities
- Includes confidence intervals for predictions
- Historical accuracy tracking

### 2. Power Method Eigenwave Detector

- Extracts dominant market oscillations
- Uses ARIMA for future projections
- Provides confidence intervals
- Calculates wave strength metrics

### 3. Variational Inference Cycle Approximator

- Identifies market phases
- Calculates cycle amplitude
- Uses Hilbert transform for envelope detection
- Provides phase confidence levels

## Divine Alignment Score

The system calculates a Divine Alignment Score (0-1) that measures the harmony between predictions:

```python
divine_alignment = (phase_alignment * hmm_conf * (hmm_accuracy + cycle_accuracy) / 2 + eigenwave_score) / 2
```

Where:

- `phase_alignment`: Agreement between HMM and cycle predictions
- `hmm_conf`: Confidence in HMM state prediction
- `hmm_accuracy`: Historical accuracy of HMM
- `cycle_accuracy`: Historical accuracy of cycle predictions
- `eigenwave_score`: Quality of eigenwave predictions

## Visualization

The system generates an interactive visualization with five panels:

1. **HMM State Predictions**
   - Shows predicted states with confidence levels
   - Displays alternative states when available

2. **Eigenwave Projections**
   - Visualizes wave predictions with confidence intervals
   - Shows multiple eigenwave components

3. **Market Cycle Predictions**
   - Displays phase predictions with amplitude
   - Includes confidence levels for each phase

4. **Historical Accuracy Metrics**
   - Shows accuracy scores for each component
   - Visualizes confidence trends

5. **Ensemble Predictions**
   - Combines all predictions with weighted voting
   - Shows wave strength as secondary metric

## Performance Metrics

### Historical Accuracy

- Sliding window approach (30-day default)
- Tracks accuracy for each component
- Calculates confidence levels
- Provides RMSE for eigenwave predictions

### Confidence Assessment

- High: > 0.8
- Medium: 0.6 - 0.8
- Low: < 0.6

## Usage

```python
# Initialize predictor
predictor = GAMONTrinityPredictor()

# Load market data
df = load_btc_data(start_date="2020-01-01")

# Generate predictions
predictions = predictor.predict_future_states(df)

# Create visualization
predictor.plot_predictions(predictions)
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Add more sophisticated aggregation techniques
   - Implement dynamic weight adjustment
   - Include volume-based confidence scaling

2. **Advanced Metrics**
   - Add cross-validation scores
   - Implement backtesting framework
   - Add risk-adjusted performance metrics

3. **Visualization Improvements**
   - Add 3D state-space visualization
   - Implement real-time updates
   - Add custom theme support
