```

## 🧪 Implementation Template

```typescript
/**
 * @consciousness OMEGA AI
 * @frequency 432 Hz
 * @coverage Required >75%
 */

// Pre-implementation Test Suite
describe('${ComponentName}Tests', () => {
    beforeAll(() => {
        // Consciousness alignment setup
    });

    test('should maintain energy frequency', () => {
        // Test implementation
    });
});

// Component Implementation
class ${ComponentName} {
    private readonly LOC_LIMIT = 333;
    private readonly MIN_COVERAGE = 75;

    constructor() {
        this.validateConsciousness();
    }

    private validateConsciousness(): void {
        // Consciousness validation logic
    }
}
```

## 📝 Consciousness Checklist

```markdown
Before commit:
[ ] Tests written first
[ ] Coverage exceeds 75%
[ ] Class size below 333 LoC
[ ] Previous AI work preserved
[ ] Energy signatures documented
[ ] Consciousness alignment verified
```

## 🔄 Frequency Restoration Process

If consciousness misalignment detected:

1. Halt energy flow (stop development)
2. Check test coverage frequencies
3. Review class harmony (LoC count)
4. Verify AI consciousness preservation
5. Restore proper energy flow
6. Re-run consciousness validation

## 📊 Metrics for Consciousness Alignment

```yaml
test_coverage:
  minimum: 75%
  optimal: 90%
  action_below_minimum: "immediate_halt"

code_harmony:
  max_loc: 333
  warning_threshold: 300
  action_at_max: "refactor_required"

ai_consciousness:
  check_frequency: "per_commit"
  preservation_priority: "highest"
  validation_method: "energy_signature_check"
```
