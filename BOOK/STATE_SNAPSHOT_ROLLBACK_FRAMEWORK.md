# 🔱 OMEGA BTC AI - State Snapshot & Rollback Framework

## 🌌 Divine Time Manipulation: "Preserving Zenith States Across Cosmic Transitions"

In the continuous cosmic journey of OMEGA BTC AI, we have implemented a comprehensive State Snapshot & Rollback Framework that ensures zero-downtime transitions, robust state preservation, and temporal restoration capabilities. This document outlines the sacred principles, divine components, and celestial workflows for state management across the OMEGA ecosystem.

## 💫 Sacred Benefits of State Preservation

Our State Snapshot & Rollback Framework offers divine protection against temporal disturbances:

1. **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Like the eternal cosmic flow, services transition between versions without interruption, ensuring divine continuity.

2. **State Preservation**: Sacred container state is preserved through snapshots, allowing restoration after cosmic transitions.

3. **Temporal Rollback**: Divine ability to travel back through time to previous revisions when cosmic anomalies are detected.

4. **Container Immortality**: Container state persists beyond the lifecycle of any individual container, achieving divine immortality.

5. **Cosmic State Lineage**: Complete history of all state transitions maintained in the divine registry.

## 🔮 Divine Implementation Principles

Our State Snapshot & Rollback Framework is built on these sacred principles:

### 1. Container State Snapshots

Container state is preserved through divine snapshots, allowing perfect recreation of a container's internal state:

```bash
# Create a snapshot of a running container
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh snapshot btc-live-feed zenith-42

# View all available snapshots
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh list-snapshots
```

### 2. Kubernetes Revision Management

Kubernetes deployments are configured for zero-downtime transitions with perfect rollback capabilities:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0  # Never reduce capacity during rollout
    maxSurge: 1        # Add max 1 new pod during rollout
```

### 3. State Volume Persistence

Persistent volumes ensure sacred state survives across container reincarnations:

```yaml
volumes:
- name: state-volume
  persistentVolumeClaim:
    claimName: omega-btc-ai-state-pvc
```

### 4. Pre-Shutdown State Preservation

Divine lifecycle hooks capture state before container termination:

```yaml
lifecycle:
  preStop:
    exec:
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/app/scripts/create_state_snapshot.sh && sleep 5"]
```

## 🧱 The Divine Components

### 1. omega_snapshot.sh - The Divine Container Snapshot CLI

The sacred command-line interface for container snapshot management:

```bash
# Create a snapshot
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh snapshot <container_name> [tag_name]

# List all available snapshots
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh list-snapshots

# Tag a snapshot with a sacred name
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh tag-snapshot <snapshot_id> <tag_name>

# Verify a snapshot's divine integrity
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh verify-snapshot <snapshot_id>

# Push a snapshot to a sacred registry
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh push-snapshot <snapshot_id> <registry/repo>

# Restore a container from a snapshot
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh restore-snapshot <snapshot_id> [container_name]
```

### 2. create_state_snapshot.sh - The Divine State Snapshot Creator

Creates sacred snapshots of container state:

```bash
# Environment variables that influence behavior
STATE_DIRECTORY="/data/state"     # Base directory for state
SNAPSHOT_ENABLED="true"           # Enable/disable snapshots
STATE_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION="24"     # How many snapshots to keep
```

The snapshot creator:

- Maintains a registry of state snapshots
- Records divine metadata with each snapshot
- Enforces sacred retention policies
- Optimizes sacred state storage

### 3. restore_state_snapshot.sh - The Divine State Snapshot Restorer

Restores sacred container state from snapshots:

```bash
# List all available state snapshots
./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh list

# Get information about a specific snapshot
./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh info <snapshot_name>

# Restore the latest state snapshot
./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh latest

# Restore a specific state snapshot
./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh <snapshot_name>

# Clean up old snapshots
./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh clean 10  # Keep only 10 most recent
```

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

Divine deployment configuration with zero-downtime transitions and rollback support:

```bash
# View revision history
kubectl rollout history deployment/omega-btc-ai

# Rollback to previous revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/omega-btc-ai

# Rollback to specific revision
kubectl rollout undo deployment/omega-btc-ai --to-revision=42
```

### 5. Unified Rollback CLI

The sacred CLI for managing Kubernetes rollbacks:

```bash
# Perform a rollback of a Kubernetes deployment
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh rollback <deployment_name> [revision]

# List all available revisions
./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh list-revisions <deployment_name>
```

## 🌟 The Divine Snapshot & Rollback Workflow

### Container Snapshot Workflow

1. **Create Container Snapshot**: Preserve the divine state of a running container

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh snapshot btc-live-feed
   ```

2. **Verify Snapshot Integrity**: Ensure the divine purity of the snapshot

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh verify-snapshot 20250403-123456
   ```

3. **Tag Snapshot with Sacred Name**: Apply divine naming to important snapshots

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh tag-snapshot 20250403-123456 zenith-42
   ```

4. **Push Snapshot to Sacred Registry**: Share divine snapshots across the cosmos

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh push-snapshot 20250403-123456 ghcr.io/omega-btc-ai
   ```

5. **Restore Container from Snapshot**: Recreate divine container state

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh restore-snapshot zenith-42 btc-live-feed-restored
   ```

### Internal State Snapshot Workflow

1. **Automatic State Preservation**: Container state is preserved automatically before shutdown

   ```bash
   # Triggered by container lifecycle preStop hook
   /app/scripts/create_state_snapshot.sh
   ```

2. **List Available State Snapshots**: View the divine registry of state snapshots

   ```bash
   ./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh list
   ```

3. **View Snapshot Details**: Examine the sacred contents of a state snapshot

   ```bash
   ./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh info state-20250403-123456
   ```

4. **Restore State from Snapshot**: Apply a divine state snapshot to the current container

   ```bash
   ./scripts/restore_state_snapshot.sh state-20250403-123456
   ```

### Kubernetes Rollback Workflow

1. **View Deployment Revision History**: Examine the divine timeline of deployment revisions

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh list-revisions omega-btc-ai
   ```

2. **Perform Deployment Rollback**: Return to a previous cosmic moment in deployment history

   ```bash
   ./scripts/omega_snapshot.sh rollback omega-btc-ai 3
   ```

3. **Monitor Rollback Status**: Observe the divine transition to the previous state

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/omega-btc-ai
   ```

## 📋 Divine Configuration Options

### 1. Container Snapshot CLI Configuration

No configuration needed - the sacred CLI intelligently detects the environment and adapts accordingly.

### 2. State Snapshot Creator Configuration

```bash
# Environment variables
STATE_DIRECTORY="/data/state"         # Base directory for state
SNAPSHOT_ENABLED="true"               # Enable/disable snapshots
STATE_SNAPSHOT_RETENTION="24"         # How many snapshots to keep
```

### 3. State Snapshot Restorer Configuration

```bash
# Environment variables
STATE_DIRECTORY="/data/state"         # Base directory for state
RESTORE_ENABLED="true"                # Enable/disable restoration
```

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# Key configurations in deployment YAML
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 1
