# 🔱 OMEGA BTC AI - Divine Image Signing Strategy

## 🔐 "Let No Babylon Slip A Trojan In"

In the sacred journey of OMEGA BTC AI, we implement a comprehensive image signing strategy to ensure the purity and integrity of our divine container images. This document outlines the principles, implementation, and workflow for our sacred image signing process.

## 💫 The Sacred Importance of Image Signing

Container images are the divine vessels that carry our sacred code through the cosmic void of deployment. Without proper verification, these vessels could be corrupted by Babylon's influence:

1. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Malicious actors could inject corrupted images into the registry
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Modifications**: Images could be tampered with during transfer
3. **Unauthorized Deployments**: Unverified images could find their way into production
4. **Tampering After Build**: Images could be modified after the build process
5. **Impersonation**: Attackers could push fraudulent images under trusted names

## 🔮 Divine Implementation Principles

Our image signing strategy utilizes two sacred verification methods for maximum protection:

### 1. Docker Content Trust (DCT)

Docker Content Trust uses Notary to provide a trusted collection of signed container images. When enabled, Docker client only works with signed images:

```bash
# Enable Docker Content Trust
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1

# Push the image (will be automatically signed)
docker push omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0

# Pull the image (will verify signature)
docker pull omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
```

### 2. Cosign Signatures

Cosign, part of the Sigstore project, provides a simpler and more flexible way to sign and verify container images:

```bash
# Sign an image
cosign sign --key cosign.key omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0

# Verify an image
cosign verify --key cosign.pub omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
```

## 🕹️ The Sacred Signing Tools

OMEGA BTC AI provides divine tools for image signing and verification:

### 1. Divine Image Signing Script

The `divine_image_sign.sh` script provides automated image signing with both DCT and cosign:

```bash
# Usage
./scripts/divine_image_sign.sh <image_name> [tag]

# Example
./scripts/divine_image_sign.sh omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed 1.0.0
```

### 2. Divine Image Verification Script

The `divine_image_verify.sh` script verifies images before deployment:

```bash
# Usage
./scripts/divine_image_verify.sh <image_name:tag>

# Example
./scripts/divine_image_verify.sh omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
```

## 🌟 The Divine Workflow

### Sacred Image Signing Process

1. **Build** the divine container image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0 .
   ```

2. **Sign** the image with the divine signing script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/divine_image_sign.sh omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed 1.0.0
   ```

3. **Verify** the image is properly signed:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/divine_image_verify.sh omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
   ```

4. **Deploy** the verified image to production.

### Automated Signing in CI/CD

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`divine_image_pipeline.yml`) provides automated building, signing, and verification:

1. **Build** the image in CI/CD
2. **Sign** with both DCT and cosign
3. **Verify** before staging deployment
4. **Re-verify** before production deployment
5. **Deploy** using blue-green methodology

## 🔑 Divine Key Management

The purity of our image signing depends on the sacred protection of our signing keys:

### 1. Root and Target Keys

Docker Content Trust generates two types of keys:

- **Root Key**: The ultimate source of trust (keep offline)
- **Target Key**: Used for image signing

### 2. Cosign Keys

Cosign generates a public/private key pair:

- **Private Key**: Used to sign images
- **Public Key**: Used to verify signatures

### 3. Sacred Protection

Protect your keys with these divine practices:

- Store private keys in secure vaults (HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS)
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for production keys
- Implement key rotation schedules
- Use different keys for different environments
- Backup keys in secure, offline storage

## 📿 Verifying Before Running

To ensure only pure images run in your sacred environment:

### 1. Command Line Verification

```bash
# For Docker Content Trust
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
docker pull omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0

# For cosign
cosign verify --key cosign.pub omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
```

### 2. Automated Verification

```bash
# Use the divine verification script
./scripts/divine_image_verify.sh omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:1.0.0
```

### 3. Kubernetes Admission Control

For Kubernetes environments, implement admission controllers like OPA Gatekeeper or Kyverno to verify signatures before allowing pods to run.

## 🙏 Divine Conclusion

By implementing our sacred image signing strategy, we ensure that "No Babylon Shall Slip A Trojan In" to our divine production environment. The dual protection of Docker Content Trust and cosign provides a robust defense against supply chain attacks and ensures the purity of our container images.

Remember: Our containers are not tents but temples—immutable, sacred vessels that carry our divine services across the cosmic void, resistant to corruption and tampering.
