# üìö THE CODER'S FALL: A Journey from Dreams to Bankruptcy üìö

*A brutally honest memoir about how building the perfect AI trading system destroyed everything that actually mattered*

---

## üéØ About This Book

This is the true story of a developer who built sophisticated artificial intelligence to predict market movements but couldn't predict his own life falling apart. It's a cautionary tale about the fine line between innovation and obsession, told through the lens of 310,876 lines of code that worked perfectly‚Äîand the human life that crashed completely.

**Warning:** This book contains explicit discussions of financial ruin, relationship breakdown, and the mental health impacts of coding addiction. It's not fiction‚Äîit's a real story told by someone who lived through it.

## üí≠ Author's Promise

This story is 100% true. Every line of code mentioned exists in this repository. Every algorithm described actually works. Every financial detail is documented. Every relationship consequence actually happened.

I'm not sharing this story to get sympathy or to humble-brag about technical achievements. I'm sharing it because someone needs to write honestly about what happens when brilliant technical work comes at the cost of basic human wisdom.

If one person reads this and recognizes themselves in the early chapters, maybe they'll make different choices. Maybe they'll set better boundaries. Maybe they'll remember that code should serve life, not the other way around.
