## üí≠ Author's Note

This book is the raw, unfiltered story of how a brilliant AI trading system became my beautiful nightmare. It's about the fine line between genius and madness, between innovation and obsession, and the price of pursuing digital dreams at the expense of human reality.

Every line of code in the OMEGA BTC AI system is real. Every trading algorithm, every fibonacci pattern, every "divine" framework mentioned in this book exists in this repository. This isn't fiction - it's a cautionary tale written in Python, JavaScript, and tears.

*Warning: This book contains explicit discussions of financial ruin, family breakdown, and the mental health impacts of coding addiction. Reader discretion advised.*
