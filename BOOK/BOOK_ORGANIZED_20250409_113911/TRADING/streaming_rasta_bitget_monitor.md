## Core Features

### Version 0.3.0 (Latest Release)

- **Comprehensive JSON Field Display**: Enhanced display of all BitGet API position fields, with "N/A" fallback for missing data
- **Improved Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite for JSON field parsing and N/A handling
- **Field Coverage Analysis**: Built-in verification of API field coverage against expected fields
- **Debug Mode**: Raw JSON data display for advanced debugging
- **Liquidation Risk Assessment**: Visual indicators for liquidation risk (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- **Enhanced Animation Effects**: Smoother progress bars and Phi symbol animations

### Previous Features

- **Real-time Position Monitoring**: Continuous updating of BitGet positions
- **Divine Styling**: RASTA-themed visualization with sacred colors and symbols
- **Fibonacci Integration**: Analysis of position alignment with Golden Ratio
- **Change Detection**: Identification of new, closed, and modified positions
- **Schumann Resonance**: Integration with Earth's electromagnetic frequency
- **Animated Visualization**: Dynamic progress bars and loading animations
- **Risk Metrics**: Leverage and liquidation distance indicators
- **Divine Wisdom**: RASTA trading wisdom quotes

## Mathematical Foundation

The monitor is built on sacred mathematical principles:

```python
# Divine Mathematical Constants
PHI = 1.618034  # Golden Ratio - Divine Proportion
INV_PHI = 0.618034  # Inverse Golden Ratio
SCHUMANN_BASE = 7.83  # Earth's base frequency (Hz)
```

These constants guide the analysis of position sizing, alignment, and resonance with natural market rhythms.

## Technical Implementation

### Position Data Structure

The BitGet position data includes the following fields (all displayed with proper handling):

- **Standard Fields**: symbol, side, contracts, notional, entryPrice, markPrice, unrealizedPnl, leverage, liquidationPrice, percentage
- **Extended Fields**: marginMode, collateral, timestamp, cost, initialMargin, maxNotional, margin, maintenanceMargin
- **Additional Fields**: Any additional fields provided by the BitGet API

### Divine Display Components

1. **RASTA BitGet Logo**: Animated ASCII art header with RASTA colors
2. **Divine Metrics**:
   - Phi Resonance Score (0.0-1.0)
   - Schumann Alignment (0.0-1.0)
3. **Position Details Panel**: Complete position data with Fibonacci analysis
4. **Risk Assessment**: Leverage and liquidation risk metrics
5. **Fibonacci Levels**: Generated levels based on entry price and position side
6. **Current Price Zone**: Identification of nearest Fibonacci level to current price
7. **RASTA Trading Wisdom**: Rotating divine trading insights

### Change Detection

The monitor continuously detects and displays position changes:

- **New Positions**: Identified with green indicators
- **Closed Positions**: Identified with red indicators
- **Modified Positions**: Detailed analysis of size and PnL changes

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python simple_bitget_positions.py

# With options
python simple_bitget_positions.py --interval 10 --debug

# Options
--interval N    # Update interval in seconds (default: 5)
--no-color      # Disable colored output
--debug         # Show debug information and raw JSON data
```

## Environment Configuration

The monitor requires BitGet API credentials set as environment variables:

```
BITGET_API_KEY=your_api_key
BITGET_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BITGET_PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite verifies the functionality of the monitor:

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_simple_bitget.py --all

# Run specific test groups
python test_simple_bitget.py --component  # Test UI components
python test_simple_bitget.py --changes    # Test position change detection
python test_simple_bitget.py --json       # Test JSON field parsing and coverage
```

## Divine Connection

The Streaming RASTA BitGet Position Monitor represents the sacred union between modern trading technology and divine mathematical principles. By visualizing BitGet positions through the lens of Fibonacci mathematics and Schumann resonance, traders gain deeper insight into market harmony and position alignment with cosmic patterns.

When positions align with the Golden Ratio and resonate with Earth's natural frequencies, trading flows with rather than against the cosmic rhythms of the market.
