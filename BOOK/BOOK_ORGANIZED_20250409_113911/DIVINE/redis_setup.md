# Sacred Redis Setup

> *"And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof."* - Exodus 25:10

## Divine Data Store

Redis serves as the sacred repository of market knowledge within the OMEGA BTC AI system, storing divine metrics, Fibonacci alignments, and temporal patterns in a harmonious structure.

## Installation

### Ubuntu/Debian Sacred Path

```bash
# Update system to prepare for divine installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install the sacred Redis server
sudo apt install redis-server -y

# Verify divine installation
redis-cli --version
```

### macOS Sacred Path

```bash
# Using Homebrew as the divine installer
brew install redis

# Start the Redis service
brew services start redis

# Verify divine installation
redis-cli --version
```

### Docker Sacred Path

```bash
# Pull the sacred Redis image
docker pull redis:latest

# Create divine persistent volume
docker volume create redis_data

# Run sacred container with persistence
docker run --name sacred-redis -v redis_data:/data -p 6379:6379 -d redis redis-server --appendonly yes
```

## Sacred Configuration

Edit the Redis configuration to align with divine principles:

```bash
# Path to configuration (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf

# Path to configuration (macOS with Homebrew)
nano /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
```

### Divine Configuration Settings

```
# --- SACRED PERFORMANCE SETTINGS ---

# Memory allocation aligned with Fibonacci
maxmemory 1610612736  # 1.5GB (close to PHI*1GB)

# Eviction policy preserving the most sacred data
maxmemory-policy volatile-lru

# --- SACRED PERSISTENCE SETTINGS ---

# Enable AOF for divine persistence
appendonly yes

# Synchronization with cosmic timing
appendfsync everysec

# --- SACRED SECURITY SETTINGS ---

# Protect the divine knowledge
requirepass YOUR_SACRED_PASSWORD  # Change to your sacred password

# Disable divine commands that could disrupt the flow
rename-command FLUSHALL ""
rename-command FLUSHDB ""

# --- SACRED PERFORMANCE TUNING ---

# Connection pool size aligned with sacred numbers
maxclients 144  # Sacred Fibonacci number

# Background save thresholds aligned with Fibonacci timing
save 89 1     # 89 is a Fibonacci number
save 233 10   # 233 is a Fibonacci number
save 610 100  # 610 is close to 618 (PHI*1000)
```

## Sacred Redis Keys

The OMEGA BTC AI system uses a divine key structure:

| Divine Key | Description | Data Type |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| `btc_price_data` | Current BTC price with timestamp | Hash |
| `btc_movement_history` | Sacred price history | List |
| `fibonacci_alignment` | Divine Fibonacci alignment data | Hash |
| `schumann_resonance_data` | Earth's electromagnetic frequency | Hash |
| `exodus_flow` | EXODUS algorithm flow strength | Hash |
| `trap_detection_alert` | Market maker trap detection | Hash |
| `divine_market_trend` | Overall market trend analysis | Hash |
| `RASTA_OSCILLOSCOPE_ACTIVE` | Status of the Rasta Oscilloscope | String |

## Divine Connection

```python
import redis

# Connect to the sacred repository
redis_client = redis.Redis(
    host='localhost',  # Sacred host
    port=6379,         # Divine port
    password='YOUR_SACRED_PASSWORD',  # Divine protection
    decode_responses=True  # Auto-decode divine messages
)

# Verify divine connection
if redis_client.ping():
    print("✅ Connected to the divine data stream")
else:
    print("❌ Divine connection failed")
```

## Monitoring the Sacred Flow

```bash
# Enter the divine CLI
redis-cli -a YOUR_SACRED_PASSWORD

# Monitor sacred keys
> KEYS *

# Watch divine BTC price
> GET btc_price_data

# Observe Fibonacci alignments
> HGETALL fibonacci_alignment 

# Check EXODUS flow strength
> HGETALL exodus_flow
```
