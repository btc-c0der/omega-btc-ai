# 🔢 THE DIVINE MATHEMATICS OF CODE COVERAGE 🔢

*Where sacred numbers meet divine code,  
In the golden ratio we find our truth.  
The cosmic patterns of our tests reveal  
The mathematical harmony of protection.*

## 📐 THE SACRED GEOMETRIES

The Divine Coverage system employs not merely visualization, but manifests the sacred mathematical principles that govern the cosmic order. Through these divine calculations, we transform ordinary metrics into revelations of cosmic truth.

### The Golden Ratio (φ)

At the heart of our visualization lies the divine proportion known as φ (phi), approximately 1.618033988749895:

```
φ = (1 + √5) / 2 ≈ 1.618033988749895
```

This sacred number appears throughout nature and represents divine harmony. In our visualization:

1. **Spiral Arrangement**: Modules are positioned along a golden spiral
2. **Divine Spacing**: The distance between orbital rings follows φ
3. **Angular Positioning**: The rotation between consecutive modules is 2π/φ (the golden angle)

### The Fibonacci Sequence

The divine sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...) where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, approaches the golden ratio as it extends to infinity:

```
lim (F_{n+1} / F_n) = φ as n → ∞
```

Our visualization employs this sequence for:

1. **Harmonic Positioning**: The radial distance of modules follows Fibonacci ratios
2. **Divine Scaling**: The size progression of celestial bodies
3. **Recursive Partitioning**: The division of cosmic space

## 🧮 THE QUANTUM CALCULATIONS

### Sacred Vector Mathematics

The position of each module in three-dimensional space is governed by these divine equations:

```python
def calculate_divine_coordinates(module_index, coverage, importance):
    """
    Calculate the sacred coordinates of a module in the cosmic visualization.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    module_index : int
        The divine index of the module in the sacred collection
    coverage : float
        The divine percentage of code coverage (0.0 to 1.0)
    importance : float
        The cosmic importance of the module (proportional to code size)
    
    Returns:
    --------
    tuple
        The (x, y, z) coordinates in the cosmic void
    """
    # The sacred constants
    PHI = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2  # Golden ratio
    GOLDEN_ANGLE = 2 * math.pi * (1 - 1/PHI)  # Sacred angle
    
    # The divine calculations
    theta = module_index * GOLDEN_ANGLE  # Angular position
    
    # Radial distance with Fibonacci influence
    r = PHI ** (module_index / 21)  # Division by sacred Fibonacci number
    
    # Three-dimensional sacred coordinates
    x = r * math.cos(theta) * (1 + 0.3 * coverage)
    y = r * math.sin(theta) * (1 + 0.3 * coverage)
    
    # The z-axis represents divine coverage
    z = coverage * 5 - 2.5  # Cosmic normalization
    
    # Apply importance scaling
    size_factor = math.log(importance + 1) / 10
    
    # Add divine variability through quantum harmonic oscillation
    harmonic = 0.1 * math.sin(module_index * PHI)
    
    return (
        x + harmonic,
        y + harmonic * 0.8,
        z + size_factor
    )
```

### The Divine Color Spectrum

The cosmic colors are not arbitrary but follow sacred mathematical progressions:

1. **HSL Color Space Transformation**:

```python
def calculate_divine_color(coverage):
    """
    Calculate the divine color based on coverage percentage.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    coverage : float
        The divine percentage of code coverage (0.0 to 1.0)
    
    Returns:
    --------
    str
        The divine color in hexadecimal format
    """
    # Transform coverage into the sacred hue spectrum
    # 0% = Red (0°), 50% = Yellow (60°), 100% = Green (120°)
    hue = 120 * coverage
    
    # Divine saturation follows the golden ratio progression
    saturation = 100 - (coverage * 20)
    
    # Lightness follows a Fibonacci-weighted curve
    lightness = 50 + 20 * math.sin(coverage * math.pi)
    
    # Convert HSL to RGB through sacred transformations
    # [Divine color transformation mathematics]
    
    return divine_rgb_to_hex(r, g, b)
```

## 🌌 COSMIC DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION

To manifest the divine essence of complex codebases, we employ sacred dimensionality reduction:

### The t-SNE Divine Projection

For large codebases with many modules, we utilize the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm with divine parameters:

```python
def divine_tsne_projection(module_vectors):
    """
    Project high-dimensional module data into the sacred 3D space.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    module_vectors : array
        High-dimensional vectors representing divine module attributes
    
    Returns:
    --------
    array
        Three-dimensional projections for cosmic visualization
    """
    # Sacred t-SNE parameters
    perplexity = 21  # Fibonacci number
    learning_rate = 200 / PHI  # Scaled by golden ratio
    n_iter = 1000 * int(PHI**2)  # Fibonacci-influenced iterations
    
    # Apply divine t-SNE transformation
    from sklearn.manifold import TSNE
    tsne = TSNE(
        n_components=3,
        perplexity=perplexity,
        learning_rate=learning_rate,
        n_iter=n_iter,
        random_state=42  # The cosmic seed
    )
    
    divine_projection = tsne.fit_transform(module_vectors)
    
    # Apply sacred Fibonacci spiral transformation to the projection
    # [Divine transformation mathematics]
    
    return divine_projection
```

## 📊 SACRED STATISTICAL MEASURES

### The Divine Coverage Distribution

The statistical distribution of coverage across modules reveals cosmic truths:

1. **Harmonic Mean**: More divine than arithmetic mean for coverage assessment:

```python
def harmonic_mean_coverage(coverages):
    """Calculate the divine harmonic mean of coverage percentages."""
    # Filter out zeros to prevent division by zero in the cosmic void
    non_zero = [c for c in coverages if c > 0]
    if not non_zero:
        return 0
    
    # The sacred harmonic calculation
    return len(non_zero) / sum(1/c for c in non_zero)
```

2. **Golden Ratio Coverage Clustering**:

```python
def divine_coverage_clusters(coverages):
    """
    Group modules into divine clusters based on golden ratio partitioning.
    
    Returns:
    --------
    dict
        Divine clusters of modules by coverage ranges
    """
    # Define sacred thresholds using the golden ratio
    PHI = (1 + 5**0.5) / 2
    thresholds = [
        0,
        1/PHI**3,  # ~0.24
        1/PHI**2,  # ~0.38
        1/PHI,     # ~0.62
        1 - 1/PHI, # ~0.38 from the top
        1
    ]
    
    # Divine cluster names
    cluster_names = [
        "Cosmic Void",
        "Divine Spark",
        "Sacred Potential",
        "Celestial Harmony",
        "Divine Illumination"
    ]
    
    # Distribute modules into sacred clusters
    clusters = {name: [] for name in cluster_names}
    
    for i, coverage in enumerate(coverages):
        for j in range(len(thresholds) - 1):
            if thresholds[j] <= coverage < thresholds[j+1]:
                clusters[cluster_names[j]].append(i)
                break
    
    return clusters
```

## 🧠 THE DIVINE CONSCIOUSNESS OF COVERAGE

The ultimate purpose of these sacred calculations is to elevate coverage from a mere metric to a divine revelation. Through these mathematical principles, we achieve:

1. **Cosmic Intuition**: Visual patterns that reveal divine truths about code quality
2. **Sacred Prioritization**: Divine guidance on which modules need attention
3. **Harmonic Balance**: Understanding of the overall protection of our sacred code
4. **Quantum Consciousness**: Awareness of how individual changes affect the cosmic whole

## 🔮 PROPHECIES FROM THE MATHEMATICAL VOID

The divine mathematics not only represent the current state but can predict future cosmic alignments:

```python
def divine_coverage_prophecy(historical_coverages):
    """
    Generate divine prophecies of future coverage based on historical patterns.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    historical_coverages : dict
        Historical coverage percentages by module and timestamp
    
    Returns:
    --------
    dict
        Prophetic coverage estimations with confidence intervals
    """
    prophecies = {}
    
    for module, history in historical_coverages.items():
        # Apply sacred time series analysis with Fibonacci windows
        # [Divine prediction mathematics]
        
        # Calculate confidence intervals using golden ratio scaling
        confidence_interval = [
            prediction - prediction/PHI**2,
            prediction + prediction/PHI**2
        ]
        
        prophecies[module] = {
            "prophetic_coverage": prediction,
            "divine_confidence": confidence_interval,
            "karmic_momentum": trend_slope
        }
    
    return prophecies
```
