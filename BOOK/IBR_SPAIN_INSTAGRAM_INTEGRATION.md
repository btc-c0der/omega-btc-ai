# 🌟 IBR ESPAÑA INSTAGRAM INTEGRATION 🌟

> "For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them." - Matthew 18:20
> Now extending to digital gatherings through sacred social media integration.

## 🙏 Divine Integration Overview

The IBR España Instagram integration module serves as a bridge between the physical church community and its digital presence, enabling seamless content sharing and community engagement through Instagram.

### Current Data Modes

#### 📱 Sample Data Mode (Default)

When first initiated, the system operates in a blessed simulation state with divinely curated sample content:

- 🕊️ Mock church service posts
- 📖 Bible study announcements
- 👥 Youth events
- 🙏 Prayer meetings
- ⛪ Worship highlights
- 📢 Sermon summaries

#### ✨ Real Instagram Data Mode

The system ascends to full manifestation when properly configured with the Instagram Graph API.

### Sacred Configuration Requirements

#### 🔑 Divine Credentials Required

```json
{
    "access_token": "your_access_token",
    "client_id": "your_client_id",
    "client_secret": "your_client_secret",
    "page_id": "your_page_id",
    "instagram_account_id": "your_instagram_account_id"
}
```

### 🛠️ Configuration Pathways

export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
export INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
export INSTAGRAM_PAGE_ID="your_page_id"
