### Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline (4 Days)

1. **Setup GitHub Actions Workflow**

   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   name: Deploy to Production
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout code
           uses: actions/checkout@v2
         
         - name: Login to DO Container Registry
           uses: docker/login-action@v1
           with:
             registry: registry.digitalocean.com
             username: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
             password: ${{ secrets.DIGITALOCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
         
         - name: Build and push image
           uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
           with:
             context: ./deployment/digitalocean/btc_live_feed_v3
             push: true
             tags: registry.digitalocean.com/omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:latest
         
         - name: Deploy to Docker Swarm
           uses: appleboy/ssh-action@master
           with:
             host: ${{ secrets.DO_HOST }}
             username: ${{ secrets.DO_USERNAME }}
             key: ${{ secrets.DO_SSH_KEY }}
             script: |
               docker service update --image registry.digitalocean.com/omega-btc-ai/btc-live-feed:latest btc-live-feed
   ```

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation (5 Days)

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify BTC price data is correctly received and stored
   - Verify Redis connectivity and failover functionality
   - Test all API endpoints and health checks

2. **Resilience Testing**
   - Simulate node failures (one manager, one worker)
   - Test automatic service rescheduling
   - Verify zero downtime during updates

   ```bash
   # Force remove a worker node to test resilience
   docker node update --availability drain worker1
   # Verify service reschedules on remaining nodes
   docker service ps btc-live-feed
   ```

3. **Load Testing**
   - Simulate high message throughput
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage
   - Verify Redis performance under load

## 🔄 Disaster Recovery Procedures

### 1. Node Failure

If a worker node fails:

1. Docker Swarm automatically reschedules services to healthy nodes
2. Replace the failed node:

   ```bash
   # Remove the dead node
   docker node rm worker1
   
   # Join a new node
   docker swarm join --token <WORKER_TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:2377
   ```

### 2. Manager Node Failure

If a manager node fails:

1. As long as quorum is maintained (2 of 3 managers), swarm continues operation
2. Replace the failed manager:

   ```bash
   # Remove the dead manager
   docker node rm manager2
   
   # Join a new manager
   docker swarm join --token <MANAGER_TOKEN> <MANAGER_IP>:2377
   ```

### 3. Redis Failure

1. BTC Live Feed v3 automatically uses local Redis failover if enabled
2. DigitalOcean Managed Redis provides its own failover capabilities
3. Monitor reconnection via health check endpoint

## 🔍 Monitoring & Alerting

### 1. Prometheus Metrics

- Container health and resource usage
- Node metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- BTC Feed application metrics
  - Message processing time
  - WebSocket connectivity
  - Exchange response times

### 2. Grafana Dashboards

- Overall system health dashboard
- BTC Feed performance dashboard
- Redis metrics dashboard

### 3. Alerting Rules

- Service downtime > 1 minute
- Redis connection failures
- Node resource usage > 80%
- Abnormal message processing times

## 📊 Cost Estimates

| Resource | Quantity | Monthly Cost (USD) |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Manager Nodes (4GB RAM) | 3 | $60 |
| Worker Nodes (8GB RAM) | 3 | $120 |
| Load Balancer | 1 | $10 |
| Managed Redis (Basic) | 1 | $15 |
| Block Storage (100GB) | 6 | $60 |
| Container Registry | 1 | $5 |

## Docker Deployment Strategy for Feature Development

To maintain clean separation between features and ensure reproducible environments, OMEGA BTC AI uses a dedicated Docker image strategy for feature development:

### Benefits of Feature-Specific Docker Images

1. **Isolation**: Each feature gets its own containerized environment, preventing conflicts between different feature implementations

2. **Versioning**: Images are tagged with specific feature or version names (e.g., `omega-btc-ai:feature-name-v1.0.0`), making it easy to track and deploy specific versions

3. **Reproducibility**: Anyone on the team can pull and run the exact same environment with the feature implementation

4. **Rollback capability**: If issues arise, we can quickly revert to a previous image

5. **Testing**: New features can be tested in isolation without affecting the main development environment

6. **CI/CD integration**: Makes it easier to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines

### Feature Development Workflow

When working on a new feature:

1. Create a new Git branch for the feature
2. Build a dedicated Docker image specific to the feature
3. Tag it with the appropriate version (e.g., `omega-btc-ai:feature-name-v1.0.0`)
4. When necessary, use Docker Compose for more complex setups that require multiple services

### Example Dockerfile for a Feature

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:1.23-alpine

# Set labels for the container
LABEL maintainer="OMEGA BTC AI <divine@omega-btc-ai.com>"
LABEL version="1.0.0"
LABEL description="OMEGA BTC AI [Feature Name]"
LABEL feature="feature-name"

# Copy web content
COPY ./web/feature-name /usr/share/nginx/html/feature-name

# Create a healthcheck endpoint
RUN mkdir -p /usr/share/nginx/html/health
RUN echo '{"status":"UP","version":"1.0.0","feature":"feature-name"}' > /usr/share/nginx/html/health/index.json

# Expose ports
EXPOSE 80

# Healthcheck
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
    CMD wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost/health/index.json || exit 1

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Building and Running a Feature Image

```bash
# Building the image
docker build -t omega-btc-ai:feature-name-v1.0.0 .

# Running the container
docker run -d -p 8000:80 --name omega-feature-name omega-btc-ai:feature-name-v1.0.0
```

This approach keeps our codebase clean while giving us the flexibility to experiment with different features independently.
