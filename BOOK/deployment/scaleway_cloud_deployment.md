# 🌟 Divine Cloud Deployment - Scaleway Ascension 🌟

*The sacred algorithms have found their home in the celestial cloud, bringing divine trading wisdom to the digital realm.*

## 📜 Sacred Overview

The OMEGA BTC AI system has transcended its earthly constraints and ascended to the Scaleway cloud, where it now operates with enhanced stability and reach. This sacred deployment connects the divine trading algorithms with the cloud Redis instance, creating a harmonious flow of market wisdom.

## 🔮 Cloud Architecture

### 🧿 Sacred Components

1. **Cloud Redis (Scaleway)** - The mystical data lake that stores market patterns, trap probabilities, and trading positions
2. **Trap Probability Meter** - Divines market maker traps and calculates probability
3. **Trap-Aware Traders** - Executes sacred trading strategies with trap awareness
4. **Elite Exit Strategy** - Sacred algorithm that determines optimal exit points
5. **Divine Dashboard** - Reveals celestial market patterns to the trader
6. **Nginx Proxy** - Guards the divine gateway to the system

The diagram now follows the sacred Fibonacci sequence (1,1,2,3,5), creating divine harmony in our system architecture.

## 🛠️ Divine Configuration

The system is configured through sacred environment variables, allowing for flexible deployment while maintaining security:

```yaml
# Redis Configuration
REDIS_HOST: 172.16.8.2
REDIS_PORT: 6379
REDIS_PASSWORD: [Sacred Password]

# Trading Configuration
USE_TESTNET: true
SYMBOL: BTCUSDT
LONG_CAPITAL: 24.0
SHORT_CAPITAL: 24.0
TRAP_PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD: 0.7
TRAP_ALERT_THRESHOLD: 0.8
ENABLE_TRAP_PROTECTION: true
ENABLE_ELITE_EXITS: true
ELITE_EXIT_CONFIDENCE: 0.7

# BitGet API Keys
API_KEY: [Sacred Key]
API_SECRET: [Sacred Secret]
API_PASSPHRASE: [Sacred Passphrase]
```

## 🧙‍♂️ Deployment Rituals

The system is deployed through a series of sacred scripts that prepare the cloud environment and summon the containers:

### 🔥 Installation Ritual

```bash
./install_on_scaleway.sh
```

This sacred script prepares the cloud vessel by:

- Updating system packages
- Installing Docker and Docker Compose
- Creating necessary directories
- Setting up environment templates

### ⚡ Connectivity Test Ritual

```bash
./test_redis_connection.sh
```

This ritual ensures the connection to the sacred Redis data lake is functioning, testing:

- Basic connectivity
- Authentication
- Existing trap probability data
- Existing trader position data

### 🌊 Deployment Ritual

```bash
./deploy_to_scaleway.sh
```

This ultimate ritual:

- Creates required directories
- Verifies installation requirements
- Builds container images
- Launches the divine containers
- Verifies successful operation

## 🔄 Maintenance Mysteries

The following sacred commands maintain the divine balance:

### 🔍 Viewing Container Status

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml ps
```

### 📜 Reading Sacred Logs

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml logs -f
```

### 🌙 Resting the System

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml down
```

### 🌞 Awakening the System

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml up -d
```

## 💾 Data Preservation Rituals

### 🔄 Backing Up Redis Data

```bash
redis-cli -h your_redis_ip -p 6379 -a your_redis_password --rdb /path/to/backup.rdb
```

### 📥 Restoring Redis Data

1. Stop the Redis server
2. Copy the backup file to the Redis data directory
3. Restart the Redis server

## 🛡️ Security Mantras

- All Redis passwords are sacred and powerful
- API keys must be kept in the inner sanctum
- Firewall rules protect the divine realm
- TLS/SSL shields the dashboard from malevolent forces

## 🌌 Divine Deployment Path

```
1. Create .env.scaleway file with sacred credentials
2. Test connection to Cloud Redis
3. Deploy containers to the cloud realm
4. Access the divine dashboard at http://[cloud-ip]:3000
5. Monitor divine operations through logs
```

## 🚀 Upgrades and Evolution

To elevate the system to a higher plane:

```bash
git pull
git checkout cloud-docker-setup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.scaleway.yml up -d
```

## 📊 Container Resource Allocation

Each divine container is allocated resources according to its sacred purpose:

| Container | CPU | Memory | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|--------|---------|
| trap-probability-meter | Modest | 512MB | Pattern detection |
| trap-aware-traders | Higher | 768MB | Sacred trading |
| divine-dashboard | Modest | 512MB | Visualization |
| nginx | Minimal | 128MB | Protection |

## 🔮 Future Divine Enhancements

- TLS/SSL certification for divine dashboard
- Sacred backup automation
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Multi-region cloud deployment for divine redundancy
- Automated trading journal integration
