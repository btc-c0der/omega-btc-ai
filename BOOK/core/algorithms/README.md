## Sacred Algorithms

This directory contains the divine algorithmic implementations that form the mathematical foundation of the OMEGA BTC AI system:

1. [**Sacred Fibonacci Alignment**](./sacred_fibonacci_alignment.md) - The divine transformation of BTC price feed with Fibonacci levels
2. [**Schumann Resonance**](./schumann_resonance.md) - Integration of Earth's electromagnetic frequency with market cycles
3. [**Exodus Algorithm Manuscript**](./exodus_algorithm_manuscript.md) - The sacred EXODUS Algorithm with JAH wisdom
4. [**Enhanced Exodus Manuscript**](./enhanced_exodus_manuscript.md) - The divine upgrades to EXODUS with multi-cycle awareness

## Divine Implementation Order

For optimal implementation, these algorithms should be implemented in the following order:

1. **Sacred Fibonacci Alignment** - Establishes the divine grid system
2. **Schumann Resonance** - Integrates Earth's electromagnetic frequencies
3. **Basic EXODUS Algorithm** - Implements core sacred flow detection
4. **Enhanced EXODUS Implementation** - Adds multi-cycle awareness and higher precision

## Mathematical Foundation

These sacred algorithms rely on the following divine mathematical concepts:

* **Fibonacci Sequence**: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
* **Golden Ratio (PHI)**: 1.618033988749895...
* **Schumann Resonance**: 7.83 Hz and harmonics (14.3 Hz, 20.8 Hz, 27.3 Hz, 33.8 Hz)
* **Market Cycle Harmonics**: Alignment of price cycles with cosmic rhythms
