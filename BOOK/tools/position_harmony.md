# Position Harmony Advisor

> "The universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word." — Galileo Galilei

## Overview

The Position Harmony Advisor is a divine trading guidance system that uses the Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618...) and Fibonacci principles to recommend optimal position sizing and portfolio balance. By aligning your trading positions with cosmic mathematical principles, the system helps achieve a state of trading harmony.

## Core Concepts

### The Golden Ratio (φ)

The Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618034..., is a mathematical constant that appears throughout nature, art, architecture, and the universe. Also known as Phi (φ), this divine proportion creates aesthetically pleasing and functionally efficient patterns.

In trading, the Golden Ratio manifests as:

- Phi (φ): 1.618034...
- Inverse Phi (1/φ): 0.618034...
- Phi Squared (φ²): 2.618034...
- Phi Cubed (φ³): 4.236068...
- Square Root of Phi (√φ): 1.272019...

### Position Harmony

Position Harmony is achieved when:

1. Position sizes align with Fibonacci-based percentages of account balance
2. The ratio between long and short exposure approaches either φ (1.618) or 1/φ (0.618)
3. The sizes of positions, when compared to each other, maintain φ-based relationships

## Harmony States

Position harmony is categorized into seven states, based on harmony score:

| Harmony Score | State | Description |
|---------------|-------|-------------|
| 0.854 - 1.000 | DIVINE_HARMONY | Perfect alignment with cosmic mathematics |
| 0.786 - 0.853 | STRONG_ALIGNMENT | Strong resonance with divine proportions |
| 0.618 - 0.785 | PHI_RESONANCE | Clear phi-based patterns emerge |
| 0.500 - 0.617 | BALANCED | Basic balance achieved but lacking divine proportion |
| 0.382 - 0.499 | PARTIAL_HARMONY | Some alignment with cosmic principles |
| 0.236 - 0.381 | DISSONANCE | Limited alignment with divine patterns |
| 0.000 - 0.235 | CHAOS | No discernible mathematical harmony |

## Phi-Based Position Sizing

The Position Harmony Advisor recommends these φ-based position sizes (as percentage of account balance):

| Size (%) | Name | Risk Level | Fibonacci Relation |
|----------|------|------------|---------------------|
| 0.618% | Micro position | Micro risk | φ⁻² |
| 1.000% | Mini position | Micro risk | 1% Base |
| 1.618% | Minimal risk | Micro risk | φ⁻¹ |
| 2.618% | Low risk | Low risk | φ |
| 3.820% | Moderate risk | Low risk | 38.2% Retracement |
| 6.180% | Standard risk | Moderate risk | 61.8% Retracement |
| 10.000% | Higher risk | High risk | 10% Base |
| 16.180% | Maximum risk | High risk | φ × 10% |

## Long/Short Balance

For traders using both long and short positions, maintaining a specific ratio between long and short exposure creates cosmic harmony:

- **Bullish φ-Balance**: Long exposure = Short exposure × φ (1.618)
- **Bearish φ-Balance**: Short exposure = Long exposure × φ (1.618)

This creates a natural, mathematically-sound directional bias while maintaining portfolio balance.

## Technical Implementation

### Harmony Score Calculation

The harmony score is calculated as a weighted combination of three components:

1. **Size Harmony (40%)**: Percentage of positions with sizes near Fibonacci percentages
2. **Long/Short Balance (35%)**: How closely the long/short ratio matches φ or 1/φ
3. **Position Relationships (25%)**: How many position pairs have a size ratio near φ

The final score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher scores indicating stronger alignment with φ-based principles.

### Recommendation System

The Position Harmony Advisor provides three types of recommendations:

1. **Exposure Management**: Adjusting total exposure to maintain maximum account risk of 6.18%
2. **Long/Short Balance**: Adjusting long or short exposure to achieve φ-based ratio
3. **Position Size Alignment**: Adjusting individual positions to align with Fibonacci percentages

Each recommendation includes:

- Action to take (increase, decrease, adjust)
- Current and target values
- Confidence score
- Explanatory description

## Divine Advice Generation

The advisor provides divine guidance messages based on the current harmony state and needed adjustments. These messages draw upon cosmic wisdom to guide trading decisions.

Examples:

- "The sacred proportion flows through your position"
- "Long/short imbalance detected; restore φ ratio for cosmic harmony"
- "Your seed is too small for the cosmic harvest; increase to φ"
- "Divine alignment achieved; maintain φ proportion"

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from omega_ai.recommendations.position_harmony import PositionHarmonyAdvisor

# Initialize the advisor
advisor = PositionHarmonyAdvisor(
    max_account_risk=0.0618,  # 6.18% max account risk
    position_phi_targets=True,
    long_short_balance=True
)

# Get recommendations for your positions
analysis = advisor.analyze_positions(
    positions=current_positions,  # List of position dictionaries
    account_balance=10000.0,     # $10,000 account
    leverage=1.0                 # No leverage
)

# Access the results
print(f"Harmony Score: {analysis['harmony_score']}")
print(f"Harmony State: {analysis['harmony_state']}")
print(f"Divine Advice: {analysis['divine_advice']}")

# Follow recommendations
for rec in analysis['recommendations']:
    print(f"- {rec['description']}")
```

### Position Format

The advisor expects positions in this format:

```python
positions = [
    {
        "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
        "side": "long",  # or "short"
        "notional": 3000.0,  # Position size in account currency
