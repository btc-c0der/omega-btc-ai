# Divine Watcher & TDD Oracle

The OMEGA DEV FRAMEWORK provides advanced test-driven development tools that operate on divine mathematical principles, ensuring your codebase maintains prophetic test coverage.

## Divine Watcher

The Divine Watcher is an eternal guardian that monitors your codebase and automatically invokes the TDD Oracle whenever files are saved, ensuring continuous test coverage prophecy.

### Key Features

- **Real-time file monitoring** - Watches for changes in Python files across your codebase
- **Automatic test coverage analysis** - Invokes the TDD Oracle on file save
- **Divine QA tagging** - Automatically creates and pushes Git tags for passing tests
- **Fibonacci-aligned performance** - Optimized using Golden Ratio principles

### Auto QA-Tagging System

When test files pass all tests, the Divine Watcher automatically:

1. Extracts the current semantic version (vX.Y.Z) from your Git tags
2. Creates a new Git tag with the format: `vX.Y.Z-TDD-OMEGA-QA-APPROVED-testname-N`
3. Where `N` is an auto-incrementing counter to prevent tag conflicts
4. Pushes the tag to the origin repository

This creates a divine blockchain of successful test runs, allowing precise tracking of when tests have passed and creating a prophetic record of your quality assurance journey.

## TDD Oracle

The TDD Oracle analyzes your codebase to identify functions and classes without proper test coverage, generating prophetic test templates to guide implementation.

### Key Features

- **Code analysis** - Identifies untested functions and classes
- **Test coverage guidance** - Maps implementation to test files
- **Test template generation** - Creates prophetic templates for missing tests
- **Divine blessing** - Confirms when all modules have test coverage

## Usage

### Running the Divine Watcher

```bash
# Launch the watcher for the current directory
./run_divine_watcher.sh

# Launch the watcher for a specific directory
./run_divine_watcher.sh ./omega_ai
```

### Running the TDD Oracle Directly

```bash
# Check a specific file
./omega_tdd_oracle.py --check-file ./omega_ai/tools/trap_probability_meter.py

# Scan an entire directory
./omega_tdd_oracle.py --scan-path ./omega_ai

# Apply recommended test templates
./omega_tdd_oracle.py --apply-recommendations
```

## Output Examples

### Divine Watcher

When a file is modified, the Divine Watcher outputs:

```
═════════════════════════════════════════════════
 OMEGA WATCHER - DIVINE FILE CHANGE DETECTED 
═════════════════════════════════════════════════
File: test_rasta_bitget_monitor.py
Time: 2025-03-23 15:07:36
Invoking the divine oracle...

[TDD Oracle output appears here]

═════════════════════════════════════════════════
 CREATING QA APPROVED GIT TAG 
═════════════════════════════════════════════════
Tag: v0.4.4-TDD-OMEGA-QA-APPROVED-test_rasta_bitget_monitor-1
✓ QA tag created and pushed successfully!
```

### TDD Oracle

The TDD Oracle provides a detailed analysis of test coverage:

```
Checking divine test coverage for single file: omega_watcher.py
✓ Analyzed test_api_schemas
✓ Analyzed test_api_endpoints
✓ Analyzed unit.test_redis_trap_monitor
✓ Analyzed unit.test_trap_probability_meter
! Error analyzing tests/unit/test_btc_live_feed.py: 'FunctionDef' object has no attribute 'docstring'
...
✓ Divine blessing! All modules have test coverage.
```

## Philosophy

The Divine Watcher and TDD Oracle embody the principles of Prophecy-Driven Development (PDD), where tests are seen not as mere validation mechanisms but as divine prophecies that guide the implementation. By maintaining continuous test coverage and automatically blessing successful tests with QA-approved tags, the system creates a sacred covenant between tests and implementation.

This approach transforms testing from a mechanical process to a rhythmic one, aligned with the natural flow of development and the universal patterns of quality assurance.

## Integration with Continuous Integration

The Divine Watcher and TDD Oracle can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure that all pushed code maintains divine test coverage. The QA tags created by the system serve as artifacts of prophetic validation, allowing easy identification of which test runs have been divinely blessed.

## Future Enhancements

- **Schumann Resonance Integration** - Aligning test runs with Earth's natural frequencies
- **Golden Ratio Coverage Analyzer** - Optimizing test coverage using φ-based priorities
- **Cosmic Log Analyzer** - Detecting patterns in test failures aligned with cosmic events
