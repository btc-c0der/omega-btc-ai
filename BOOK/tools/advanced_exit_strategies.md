# Advanced Exit Strategies for RastaBitgetMonitor

> "The divine art of position unwinding rivals the creation of the position itself. Exits are where profits are truly crystallized." - OMEGA Wisdom

## Overview

The RastaBitgetMonitor (RBM) v0.4.0 now includes advanced exit strategies that go beyond simple take-profit and stop-loss management. These strategies incorporate Fibonacci principles, fee management, hedge positioning calculations, and bidirectional Fibonacci level visualization.

This document details the mathematical principles, implementation, and usage of these advanced exit strategies within the RBM system.

## 1. Fee Coverage Analysis

### Core Concept

Every position incurs trading fees at entry and exit. The Fee Coverage Analysis constantly calculates how far the current price movement is from covering:

- Entry fees
- Potential exit fees
- Position funding fees (for perpetual contracts)

### Implementation

```python
def calculate_fee_coverage(position, current_price):
    # Extract position details
    entry_price = position['entry_price']
    size = position['size']
    direction = position['side']  # 'long' or 'short'
    leverage = position['leverage']
    
    # Fee constants (from BitGet)
    maker_fee = 0.0002  # 0.02%
    taker_fee = 0.0005  # 0.05%
    funding_rate = get_current_funding_rate(position['symbol'])
    
    # Calculate total fees paid and anticipated
    entry_fee = size * entry_price * taker_fee
    exit_fee = size * current_price * taker_fee
    
    # Calculate funding fee (if position held for 8 hours)
    funding_fee = size * current_price * abs(funding_rate)
    
    # Total fee cost
    total_fees = entry_fee + exit_fee + funding_fee
    
    # Calculate current P&L
    if direction == 'long':
        unrealized_pnl = size * (current_price - entry_price)
    else:
        unrealized_pnl = size * (entry_price - current_price)
    
    # Calculate fee coverage
    fee_coverage_percent = (unrealized_pnl / total_fees) * 100
    
    return {
        'total_fees': total_fees,
        'unrealized_pnl': unrealized_pnl,
        'fee_coverage_percent': fee_coverage_percent,
        'fee_breakeven_price': calculate_fee_breakeven_price(position, total_fees)
    }
```

### RBM Display

The RBM now shows:

- Fee Coverage: x% (how much of the fees are covered by current P&L)
- Fee Breakeven: price at which all fees are covered
- Time to Fee Coverage: estimated time to reach fee coverage based on recent price movement

### Exit Recommendation

The system recommends a partial position exit of 10-20% when:

- Fee coverage reaches 200-300% (fees are fully covered plus profit)
- Market conditions show increased volatility
- Current price approaches a key Fibonacci resistance/support level

## 2. Complementary Position Analysis

### Core Concept

For every open position, the RBM now calculates a theoretical complementary position that could hedge the current unrealized P&L. This provides traders with insights into potential counter-position strategies.

### Implementation

```python
def calculate_complementary_position(position, current_price):
    # Extract position details
    entry_price = position['entry_price']
    size = position['size']
    direction = position['side']  # 'long' or 'short'
    symbol = position['symbol']
    
    # Calculate unrealized P&L
    if direction == 'long':
        unrealized_pnl = size * (current_price - entry_price)
    else:
        unrealized_pnl = size * (entry_price - current_price)
    
    # Calculate complementary position for the opposite direction
    complement_direction = 'short' if direction == 'long' else 'long'
    
    # Find optimal entry price for complementary position
    # This uses key Fibonacci levels from the current price
    phi = 1.618
    inv_phi = 0.618
    
    if complement_direction == 'long':
        # For a complementary long position (when current is short)
        potential_entries = [
            current_price * (1 - 0.01),  # Immediate hedge
            current_price * (1 - 0.0382),  # Small retracement
            current_price * (1 - inv_phi/10),  # 6.18% retracement
            current_price * (1 - 0.236),  # 23.6% retracement
        ]
    else:
        # For a complementary short position (when current is long)
        potential_entries = [
            current_price * (1 + 0.01),  # Immediate hedge
            current_price * (1 + 0.0382),  # Small retracement
            current_price * (1 + inv_phi/10),  # 6.18% retracement
            current_price * (1 + 0.236),  # 23.6% retracement
        ]
    
    # Calculate optimal leverage for complementary position
    # Lower leverage for immediate hedge, higher for retracement entries
    leverages = [1, 2, 3, 5]
    
    complementary_positions = []
    for entry, lev in zip(potential_entries, leverages):
        # Calculate size needed to offset unrealized_pnl
        price_movement = abs(entry - current_price)
        size_needed = abs(unrealized_pnl) / (price_movement * lev)
        
        complementary_positions.append({
            'direction': complement_direction,
            'entry_price': entry,
            'leverage': lev,
            'size': size_needed,
            'offset_percentage': min(100, (size_needed/size) * 100)
        })
    
    return complementary_positions
```

### RBM Display

The RBM now displays a "Complementary Positions" section showing:

- 3-4 potential entry points for a counter position
- Required leverage and size at each entry point
- Percentage of current position that would be offset
- Divine harmony score (how well the position would align with Fibonacci levels)

### Exit Recommendation

The system recommends position management strategies such as:

- "Consider 25% exit at current price and opening a counter-position at [price]"
- "Current unrealized PnL could be hedged with a [direction] position of [size] at [price]"
- "Strong Fibonacci resistance approaching, consider partial exit or hedge position"

## 3. Bidirectional Fibonacci Levels

### Core Concept

Regardless of the current position direction, traders benefit from seeing Fibonacci levels for both potential long and short trades. The enhanced RBM now displays Fibonacci levels for both directions simultaneously.

### Implementation

```python
def calculate_bidirectional_fibonacci_levels(symbol, current_price):
    # Get recent high and low from price history
    price_history = get_recent_price_history(symbol, timeframe='1d', limit=7)
    recent_high = max(price_history['high'])
    recent_low = min(price_history['low'])
    
    # Standard Fibonacci ratios
    fib_ratios = [0, 0.236, 0.382, 0.5, 0.618, 0.786, 1.0, 1.618, 2.618]
    
    # Calculate Fibonacci levels for long scenario (retracement from low to high)
    long_range = recent_high - recent_low
    long_levels = {}
    for ratio in fib_ratios:
        if ratio <= 1.0:
            # Retracement levels (from high back to low)
            level_price = recent_high - (long_range * ratio)
            long_levels[f"{ratio:.3f}"] = level_price
        else:
            # Extension levels (beyond the high)
            extension = (ratio - 1.0) * long_range
            level_price = recent_high + extension
            long_levels[f"{ratio:.3f}"] = level_price
    
    # Calculate Fibonacci levels for short scenario (retracement from high to low)
    short_range = recent_high - recent_low
    short_levels = {}
    for ratio in fib_ratios:
        if ratio <= 1.0:
            # Retracement levels (from low back to high)
            level_price = recent_low + (short_range * ratio)
            short_levels[f"{ratio:.3f}"] = level_price
        else:
            # Extension levels (beyond the low)
            extension = (ratio - 1.0) * short_range
            level_price = recent_low - extension
            short_levels[f"{ratio:.3f}"] = level_price
    
    # Sort levels by price and identify closest levels to current price
    long_closest = find_closest_level(long_levels, current_price)
    short_closest = find_closest_level(short_levels, current_price)
    
    return {
        'long_levels': long_levels,
        'short_levels': short_levels,
        'long_closest': long_closest,
        'short_closest': short_closest,
        'current_price': current_price
    }
```

### RBM Display

The RBM now shows two columns of Fibonacci levels:

- **Long Perspective Levels**: Fibonacci retracements and extensions for a long strategy
- **Short Perspective Levels**: Fibonacci retracements and extensions for a short strategy
- Current price is highlighted relative to both sets of levels
- Each level shows its distance from current price in percentage terms

For the open position direction, levels are displayed with standard highlighting:

```
ACTIVE POSITION (SHORT) FIBONACCI LEVELS:
  1.000 (HIGH): $52,680 [+2.16%] ⬆️
  0.786:        $51,240 [-0.73%]
  0.618:        $50,130 [-2.89%] ✨ PHI LEVEL
  0.500:        $49,320 [-4.46%]
> CURRENT:      $48,620 
  0.382:        $48,510 [-0.23%]
  0.236:        $47,600 [-2.10%]
  0.000 (LOW):  $46,000 [-5.39%]
```

For the opposite direction, levels are displayed for reference:

```
OPPOSITE (LONG) FIBONACCI LEVELS:
  2.618:        $56,200 [+15.59%]
  1.618:        $52,130 [+7.22%] ✨ PHI LEVEL
  1.000 (HIGH): $49,100 [+0.99%]
  0.786:        $48,230 [-0.80%]
> CURRENT:      $48,620
  0.618:        $47,890 [-1.50%] ✨ PHI LEVEL
  0.500:        $47,550 [-2.20%]
  0.382:        $47,210 [-2.90%]
  0.236:        $46,780 [-3.78%]
  0.000 (LOW):  $46,000 [-5.39%]
```

### Exit Recommendation

The system offers Fibonacci-based exit recommendations:

- "Price approaching 0.618 retracement in SHORT direction, consider 30% exit"
- "LONG Fibonacci level 0.786 acting as resistance, maintain current short position"
- "Price centered between key Fibonacci levels, hold position until next level reached"

## Integration with Enhanced Fibonacci Exit Manager

The RBM's advanced exit strategies integrate directly with the `EnhancedFibonacciExitManager` to provide truly divine exit guidance:

```python
# Integration example
async def update_exit_recommendations(positions):
    for position_id, position in positions.items():
        # Get fee coverage analysis
        fee_coverage = calculate_fee_coverage(position, current_price)
        
        # Get complementary position options
        complementary_positions = calculate_complementary_position(position, current_price)
        
        # Get bidirectional Fibonacci levels
        fib_levels = calculate_bidirectional_fibonacci_levels(position['symbol'], current_price)
        
        # Apply the enhanced exit manager's wisdom
        exit_manager = EnhancedFibonacciExitManager()
        exit_strategy = await exit_manager.calculate_exit_strategy(
            position_id=position_id,
            entry_price=position['entry_price'],
            direction=position['side'],
            size=position['size'],
            leverage=position['leverage']
        )
        
        # Check for exit conditions
        should_exit, exit_info = await exit_manager.check_for_exits(
            position_id=position_id,
            current_price=current_price,
            trap_data=get_trap_data()
        )
        
        # Update the display with all exit strategy information
        update_display(
            position=position,
            fee_coverage=fee_coverage,
            complementary_positions=complementary_positions,
            fib_levels=fib_levels,
            exit_strategy=exit_strategy,
            exit_recommendation=exit_info
        )
```

## Running the Advanced Exit Systems

The advanced exit strategies are automatically active in RBM v0.4.0 and can be toggled with the following command-line options:

```bash
python simple_bitget_positions.py --enable-advanced-exits --show-all-fib-levels
```

Optional flags:

- `--fee-coverage-threshold=200`: Set minimum fee coverage percentage for exit recommendations
- `--show-complementary`: Display complementary position recommendations
