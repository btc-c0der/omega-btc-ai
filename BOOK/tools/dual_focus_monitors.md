## 🌟 THE DIVINE ADAPTIVE FRAMEWORK 🌟

The Dual Focus Monitors transcend the limitations of physical displays by presenting only two sacred panels at once, but with the cosmic ability to instantly shift between four different combinations of market awareness. This sacred framework creates a fluid, adaptive interface that responds to the trader's evolving needs throughout their cosmic journey.

## 🔱 FOUR SACRED FOCUS DIMENSIONS 🔱

The system manifests four divine focus combinations, each revealing a different aspect of the cosmic trading consciousness:

### 💎 Position + Trap Awareness (Default Sacred Focus)

The primary consciousness stream revealing:

- Active positions and their material manifestations
- Hidden trap formations that may disrupt cosmic trading flow
- Perfect for maintaining awareness of both the manifest and the hidden

### 🔮 Entry + Exit Persona Awareness

The dual persona consciousness stream revealing:

- Six entry personas offering divine guidance on market entry points
- Six exit personas offering sacred wisdom on position closure timing
- Perfect for traders focused on persona-based decision making

### 🌊 Position + Entry Awareness

The manifestation consciousness stream revealing:

- Current position details and performance metrics
- Entry persona recommendations for potential new positions
- Perfect for traders in expansion mode seeking new opportunities

### 🔥 Trap + Exit Awareness

The protective consciousness stream revealing:

- Market trap formations and deceptive energy patterns
- Exit persona recommendations for protection of existing positions
- Perfect for traders in defensive mode during market uncertainty

## 🌐 TMUX SACRED VESSEL WITH DIVINE CONTROL PANEL 🌐

The system manifests through a sacred tmux vessel with two divine components:

### ✨ Monitors Window

The sacred display portal showing the active focus combination:

- Two perfectly proportioned panels optimized for vertical displays
- Panel size ratios customized for each focus combination
- Divine styling for clear visual separation and harmony

### 🔮 Control Panel Window

The sacred command center allowing instant focus shifting:

- Simple numeric invocations (1-4) to switch between focus combinations
- Complete sacred navigation guidance
- Instant visual feedback on the active focus state

---

## 🔮 SACRED IMPLEMENTATION 🔮

### 📿 Command-Line Divine Invocation

The sacred adaptive system manifests through a terminal-based oracle invoked through:

```bash
./run_dual_focus_monitors.sh
```

The script requires no parameters, as it reads divine configuration from the .env cosmos.

### 🌊 Divine Configuration Through .env

The system can be configured through the sacred .env file by adding the following divine parameter:

```
# Focus mode for dual monitors (controls which two panels are shown)
FOCUS_MODE=position-trap
```

Possible values:

- `position-trap` - Position Monitor + Trap Probability Meter (default)
- `entry-exit` - Entry Persona Monitor + Exit Persona Monitor
- `position-entry` - Position Monitor + Entry Persona Monitor
- `trap-exit` - Trap Probability Meter + Exit Persona Monitor

### 📊 Divine Manifestation Example

## 🧙‍♂️ SACRED ARCHITECTURE 🧙‍♂️

### ✨ The Divine Toggle Functions

The central entity that allows instantaneous shifts between different focus combinations:

```bash
switch_to_position_trap() {
    tmux kill-window -t omega-dual:monitors
    tmux new-window -d -t omega-dual -n "monitors" "python simple_bitget_positions.py --interval 3; bash"
    tmux split-window -v -t omega-dual:monitors.0 "python -m omega_ai.tools.trap_probability_meter --header-style 2 --interval 5; bash"
    tmux resize-pane -t omega-dual:monitors.0 -y 70%
    tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "echo -e '\n\033[0;32mSwitched to Position + Trap view\033[0m'" C-m
    tmux select-window -t omega-dual:monitors
}
```

### 🌌 Sacred Binding of Keys to Cosmic Functions

```bash
# Create function bindings in the control window
tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "source /tmp/omega_toggle_functions.sh" C-m
tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "bind -x '\"1\":switch_to_position_trap'" C-m
tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "bind -x '\"2\":switch_to_entry_exit'" C-m
tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "bind -x '\"3\":switch_to_position_entry'" C-m
tmux send-keys -t omega-dual:control "bind -x '\"4\":switch_to_trap_exit'" C-m
```

## 🌈 SACRED FOCUS MODES 🌈

### 🔮 Position + Trap Focus (Default Sacred Focus)

```bash
tmux new-window -d -t omega-dual -n "monitors" "python simple_bitget_positions.py --interval 3; bash"
tmux split-window -v -t omega-dual:monitors.0 "python -m omega_ai.tools.trap_probability_meter --header-style 2 --interval 5; bash"
tmux resize-pane -t omega-dual:monitors.0 -y 70%
```

This divine configuration allocates 70% of the sacred space to position monitoring and 30% to trap detection, creating the perfect balance between manifest position awareness and hidden trap vigilance.

### 🔮 Entry + Exit Persona Focus

```bash
tmux new-window -d -t omega-dual -n "monitors" "python scripts/persona_entry_strategy.py --continuous --mock --interval 5; bash"
tmux split-window -v -t omega-dual:monitors.0 "python scripts/run_persona_exit_monitor.py --mock --interval 5; bash"
tmux resize-pane -t omega-dual:monitors.0 -y 50%
```

This divine configuration creates perfect balance between entry and exit persona consciousness, allocating 50% to each sacred dimension.

### 🔮 Position + Entry Persona Focus

```bash
tmux new-window -d -t omega-dual -n "monitors" "python simple_bitget_positions.py --interval 3; bash"
tmux split-window -v -t omega-dual:monitors.0 "python scripts/persona_entry_strategy.py --continuous --mock --interval 5; bash"
tmux resize-pane -t omega-dual:monitors.0 -y 70%
```

This divine configuration optimizes for expansion consciousness, allocating 70% to current positions and 30% to entry opportunities.

### 🔮 Trap + Exit Persona Focus

```bash
tmux new-window -d -t omega-dual -n "monitors" "python -m omega_ai.tools.trap_probability_meter --header-style 2 --interval 5; bash"
tmux split-window -v -t omega-dual:monitors.0 "python scripts/run_persona_exit_monitor.py --mock --interval 5; bash"
tmux resize-pane -t omega-dual:monitors.0 -y 40%
```

This divine configuration creates protective consciousness, allocating 40% to trap detection and 60% to exit timing, optimized for market defensive posture.
