 * Akin to Array.prototype.reduce(), but operating on the vertices of all the visible descendant objects, in world space.
 * Additionally, it can operate as a transform-reduce, returning a different type T than the Vector3 input.
 * This can be useful for e.g. fitting a viewing frustum to the scene.
 *
 * @param object - The object to traverse (uses traverseVisible internally).
 * @param func - The binary function applied for the reduction.
 * Must have the signature: (value: T, vertex: Vector3): T.
 * @param initialValue - The value to initialize the reduction with.
 * This is required as it also sets the reduction type, which is not required to be Vector3.
