/**
 * Light probes are an alternative way of adding light to a 3D scene.
 * @remarks
 * Unlike classical light sources (e.g
 * directional, point or spot lights), light probes do not emit light
 * Instead they store information about light passing through 3D space
 * During rendering, the light that hits a 3D object is approximated by using the data from the light probe.
 * Light probes are usually created from (radiance) environment maps
 * The class {@link THREE.LightProbeGenerator | LightProbeGenerator} can be used to create light probes from
 * instances of {@link THREE.CubeTexture | CubeTexture} or {@link THREE.WebGLCubeRenderTarget | WebGLCubeRenderTarget}
 * However, light estimation data could also be provided in other forms e.g
 * by WebXR
 * This enables the rendering of augmented reality content that reacts to real world lighting.
 * The current probe implementation in three.js supports so-called diffuse light probes
 * This type of light probe is functionally equivalent to an irradiance environment map.
 * @see Example: {@link https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_lightprobe | WebGL / light probe }
 * @see Example: {@link https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_lightprobe_cubecamera | WebGL / light probe / cube camera }
 * @see {@link https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/lights/LightProbe | Official Documentation}
