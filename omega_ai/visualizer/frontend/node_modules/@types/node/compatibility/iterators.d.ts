// Backwards-compatible iterator interfaces, augmented with iterator helper methods by lib.esnext.iterator in TypeScript 5.6.
// The IterableIterator interface does not contain these methods, which creates assignability issues in places where IteratorObjects
// are expected (eg. DOM-compatible APIs) if lib.esnext.iterator is loaded.
// Also ensures that iterators returned by the Node API, which inherit from Iterator.prototype, correctly expose the iterator helper methods
// if lib.esnext.iterator is loaded.

// Placeholders for TS <5.6
interface IteratorObject<T, TReturn, TNext> {}
interface AsyncIteratorObject<T, TReturn, TNext> {}

declare namespace NodeJS {
    // Populate iterator methods for TS <5.6
