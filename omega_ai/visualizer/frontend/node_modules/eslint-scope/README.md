# ESLint Scope

ESLint Scope is the [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) scope analyzer used in ESLint. It is a fork of [escope](http://github.com/estools/escope).

## Install

```
npm i eslint-scope --save
```

## ðŸ“– Usage

To use in an ESM file:

```js
import * as eslintScope from 'eslint-scope';
```

To use in a CommonJS file:

```js
const eslintScope = require('eslint-scope');
```

Example:

```js
import * as eslintScope from 'eslint-scope';
import * as espree from 'espree';
import estraverse from 'estraverse';

const ast = espree.parse(code, { range: true });
const scopeManager = eslintScope.analyze(ast);

const currentScope = scopeManager.acquire(ast);   // global scope

estraverse.traverse(ast, {
    enter (node, parent) {
        // do stuff

        if (/Function/.test(node.type)) {
            currentScope = scopeManager.acquire(node);  // get current function scope
        }
    },
    leave(node, parent) {
        if (/Function/.test(node.type)) {
            currentScope = currentScope.upper;  // set to parent scope
        }

        // do stuff
    }
});
```
