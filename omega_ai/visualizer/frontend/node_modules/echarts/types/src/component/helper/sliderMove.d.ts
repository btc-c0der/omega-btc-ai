/**
 * Calculate slider move result.
 * Usage:
 * (1) If both handle0 and handle1 are needed to be moved, set minSpan the same as
 * maxSpan and the same as `Math.abs(handleEnd[1] - handleEnds[0])`.
 * (2) If handle0 is forbidden to cross handle1, set minSpan as `0`.
 *
 * @param delta Move length.
 * @param handleEnds handleEnds[0] can be bigger then handleEnds[1].
 *              handleEnds will be modified in this method.
 * @param extent handleEnds is restricted by extent.
 *              extent[0] should less or equals than extent[1].
 * @param handleIndex Can be 'all', means that both move the two handleEnds.
 * @param minSpan The range of dataZoom can not be smaller than that.
 *              If not set, handle0 and cross handle1. If set as a non-negative
 *              number (including `0`), handles will push each other when reaching
 *              the minSpan.
 * @param maxSpan The range of dataZoom can not be larger than that.
 * @return The input handleEnds.
