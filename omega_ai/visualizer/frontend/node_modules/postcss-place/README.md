[PostCSS Place Properties] lets you use `place-*` properties as shorthands for `align-*`
and `justify-*`, following the [CSS Box Alignment] specification.

```pcss
.example {
  place-self: center;
  place-content: space-between center;
}

/* becomes */

.example {
  align-self: center;
  justify-self: center;
  place-self: center;
  align-content: space-between;
  justify-content: center;
  place-content: space-between center;
}
```

## Usage

Add [PostCSS Place Properties] to your project:

```bash
npm install postcss postcss-place --save-dev
```

Use it as a [PostCSS] plugin:

```js
import postcss from 'postcss';
import postcssPlace from 'postcss-place';

postcss([
  postcssPlace(/* pluginOptions */)
]).process(YOUR_CSS /*, processOptions */);
```

[PostCSS Place Properties] runs in all Node environments, with special instructions for:

| [Node](INSTALL.md#node) | [Webpack](INSTALL.md#webpack) | [Create React App](INSTALL.md#create-react-app) | [Gulp](INSTALL.md#gulp) | [Grunt](INSTALL.md#grunt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Options

### preserve

The `preserve` option determines whether the original place declaration is
preserved. By default, it is preserved.

```js
postcssPlace({ preserve: false })
```

```pcss
.example {
  place-self: center;
  place-content: space-between center;
}

/* becomes */

.example {
  align-self: center;
  justify-self: center;
  align-content: space-between;
  justify-content: center;
}
```
