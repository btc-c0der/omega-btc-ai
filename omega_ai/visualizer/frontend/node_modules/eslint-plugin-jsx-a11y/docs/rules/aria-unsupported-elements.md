# jsx-a11y/aria-unsupported-elements

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Certain reserved DOM elements do not support ARIA roles, states and properties. This is often because they are not visible, for example `meta`, `html`, `script`, `style`. This rule enforces that these DOM elements do not contain the `role` and/or `aria-*` props.

## Rule details

This rule takes no arguments.

### Succeed
```jsx
<!-- Good: the meta element should not be given any ARIA attributes -->
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

### Fail
```jsx
<!-- Bad: the meta element should not be given any ARIA attributes -->
<meta charset="UTF-8" aria-hidden="false" />
```
