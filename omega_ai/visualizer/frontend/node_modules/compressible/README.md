Compressible `Content-Type` / `mime` checking.

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install compressible
```

## API

<!-- eslint-disable no-unused-vars -->

```js
var compressible = require('compressible')
```

### compressible(type)

Checks if the given `Content-Type` is compressible. The `type` argument is expected
to be a value MIME type or `Content-Type` string, though no validation is performed.

The MIME is looked up in the [`mime-db`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-db) and
if there is compressible information in the database entry, that is returned. Otherwise,
this module will fallback to `true` for the following types:

  * `text/*`
  * `*/*+json`
  * `*/*+text`
  * `*/*+xml`

If this module is not sure if a type is specifically compressible or specifically
uncompressible, `undefined` is returned.

<!-- eslint-disable no-undef -->

```js
compressible('text/html') // => true
compressible('image/png') // => false
```
