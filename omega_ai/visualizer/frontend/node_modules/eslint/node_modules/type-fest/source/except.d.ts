/**
Create a type from an object type without certain keys.

This type is a stricter version of [`Omit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-5.html#the-omit-helper-type). The `Omit` type does not restrict the omitted keys to be keys present on the given type, while `Except` does. The benefits of a stricter type are avoiding typos and allowing the compiler to pick up on rename refactors automatically.

Please upvote [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/30825) if you want to have the stricter version as a built-in in TypeScript.

@example
```
import {Except} from 'type-fest';

type Foo = {
	a: number;
	b: string;
	c: boolean;
};

type FooWithoutA = Except<Foo, 'a' | 'c'>;
//=> {b: string};
```
*/
export type Except<ObjectType, KeysType extends keyof ObjectType> = Pick<ObjectType, Exclude<keyof ObjectType, KeysType>>;
