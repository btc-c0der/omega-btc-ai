	// String: Absolute path to the resource (optionally including query string)

	loaders: ["/abs/path/to/loader.js?query"],
	// String[]: Absolute paths to the loaders (optionally including query string)
	// {loader, options}[]: Absolute paths to the loaders with options object

	// The result
	// only available when no error occured

	// result.resourceBuffer: Buffer
	// The raw resource as Buffer (useful for SourceMaps)
	// only available when no error occured

	// result.cacheable: Bool
	// Is the result cacheable or do it require reexecution?

	// result.fileDependencies: String[]
	// An array of paths (existing files) on which the result depends on

	// result.missingDependencies: String[]
	// An array of paths (not existing files) on which the result depends on
