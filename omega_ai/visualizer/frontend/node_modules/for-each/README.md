# for-each [![build status][1]][2]

[![browser support][3]][4]

A better forEach.

## Example

Like `Array.prototype.forEach` but works on objects.

```js
var forEach = require("for-each")

forEach({ key: "value" }, function (value, key, object) {
    /* code */
})
```

As a bonus, it's also a perfectly function shim/polyfill for arrays too!

```js
var forEach = require("for-each")

forEach([1, 2, 3], function (value, index, array) {
    /* code */
})
```

## Installation

`npm install for-each`
