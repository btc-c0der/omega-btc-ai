## Minutes

### adopt a charter

* group: +1's all around

### What versioning scheme should be adopted?
* group: +1’s 3.0.0
* domenic+group: pulling in patches from other sources where appropriate
* mikeal: version independently, suggesting versions for io.js
* mikeal+domenic: work with TC to notify in advance of changes
simpler stream creation

### streamline creation of streams
* sam: streamline creation of streams
* domenic: nice simple solution posted
  but, we lose the opportunity to change the model
  may not be backwards incompatible (double check keys)

  **action item:** domenic will check

### remove implicit flowing of streams on(‘data’)
* add isFlowing / isPaused
* mikeal: worrying that we’re documenting polyfill methods – confuses users
* domenic: more reflective API is probably good, with warning labels for users
* new section for mad scientists (reflective stream access)
* calvin: name the “third state”
* mikeal: maybe borrow the name from whatwg?
* domenic: we’re missing the “third state”
* consensus: kind of difficult to name the third state
* mikeal: figure out differences in states / compat
* mathias: always flow on data – eliminates third state
  * explore what it breaks

**action items:**
* ask isaac for ability to list packages by what public io.js APIs they use (esp. Stream)
* ask rod/build for infrastructure
* **chris**: explore the “flow on data” approach
* add isPaused/isFlowing
* add new docs section
* move isPaused to that section
