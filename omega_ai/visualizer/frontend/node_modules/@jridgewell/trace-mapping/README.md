# @jridgewell/trace-mapping

> Trace the original position through a source map

`trace-mapping` allows you to take the line and column of an output file and trace it to the
original location in the source file through a source map.

You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapConsumer`. This
provides the same `originalPositionFor` and `generatedPositionFor` API, without requiring WASM.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @jridgewell/trace-mapping
```

## Usage

```typescript
import {
  TraceMap,
  originalPositionFor,
  generatedPositionFor,
  sourceContentFor,
  isIgnored,
} from '@jridgewell/trace-mapping';

const tracer = new TraceMap({
  version: 3,
  sources: ['input.js'],
  sourcesContent: ['content of input.js'],
  names: ['foo'],
  mappings: 'KAyCIA',
  ignoreList: [],
});

// Lines start at line 1, columns at column 0.
const traced = originalPositionFor(tracer, { line: 1, column: 5 });
assert.deepEqual(traced, {
  source: 'input.js',
  line: 42,
  column: 4,
  name: 'foo',
});

const content = sourceContentFor(tracer, traced.source);
assert.strictEqual(content, 'content for input.js');

const generated = generatedPositionFor(tracer, {
  source: 'input.js',
  line: 42,
  column: 4,
});
assert.deepEqual(generated, {
  line: 1,
  column: 5,
});

const ignored = isIgnored(tracer, 'input.js');
assert.equal(ignored, false);
```

We also provide a lower level API to get the actual segment that matches our line and column. Unlike
`originalPositionFor`, `traceSegment` uses a 0-base for `line`:

```typescript
import { traceSegment } from '@jridgewell/trace-mapping';

// line is 0-base.
const traced = traceSegment(tracer, /* line */ 0, /* column */ 5);

// Segments are [outputColumn, sourcesIndex, sourceLine, sourceColumn, namesIndex]
// Again, line is 0-base and so is sourceLine
assert.deepEqual(traced, [5, 0, 41, 4, 0]);
```

### SectionedSourceMaps

The sourcemap spec defines a special `sections` field that's designed to handle concatenation of
output code with associated sourcemaps. This type of sourcemap is rarely used (no major build tool
produces it), but if you are hand coding a concatenation you may need it. We provide an `AnyMap`
helper that can receive either a regular sourcemap or a `SectionedSourceMap` and returns a
`TraceMap` instance:

```typescript
import { AnyMap } from '@jridgewell/trace-mapping';
const fooOutput = 'foo';
const barOutput = 'bar';
const output = [fooOutput, barOutput].join('\n');

const sectioned = new AnyMap({
  version: 3,
  sections: [
    {
      // 0-base line and column
      offset: { line: 0, column: 0 },
      // fooOutput's sourcemap
      map: {
        version: 3,
        sources: ['foo.js'],
        names: ['foo'],
        mappings: 'AAAAA',
      },
    },
    {
      // barOutput's sourcemap will not affect the first line, only the second
      offset: { line: 1, column: 0 },
      map: {
        version: 3,
        sources: ['bar.js'],
        names: ['bar'],
        mappings: 'AAAAA',
      },
    },
  ],
});

const traced = originalPositionFor(sectioned, {
  line: 2,
  column: 0,
});

assert.deepEqual(traced, {
  source: 'bar.js',
  line: 1,
  column: 0,
  name: 'bar',
});
```
