// or selection.selectAll are converted into proper arrays when creating a
// selection; we donâ€™t ever want to create a selection backed by a live
// HTMLCollection or NodeList. However, note that selection.selectAll will use a
// static NodeList as a group, since it safely derived from querySelectorAll.
