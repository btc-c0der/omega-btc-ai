Get the ArrayBuffer out of a DataView, robustly.

This will work in node <= 0.10 and < 0.11.4, where there's no prototype accessor, only a nonconfigurable own property.
It will also work in modern engines where `DataView.prototype.buffer` has been deleted after this module has loaded.

## Example

```js
const dataViewBuffer = require('data-view-buffer');
const assert = require('assert');

const ab = new ArrayBuffer(0);
const dv = new DataView(ab);
assert.equal(dataViewBuffer(dv), ab);
```

## Tests
Simply clone the repo, `npm install`, and run `npm test`
