# string-length

> Get the real length of a string - by correctly counting astral symbols and ignoring [ansi escape codes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-ansi)

`String#length` erroneously counts [astral symbols](https://web.archive.org/web/20150721114550/http://www.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/unicode/unicode_astral.html) as two characters.

## Install

```
$ npm install string-length
```

## Usage

```js
import stringLength from 'string-length';

'🐴'.length;
//=> 2

stringLength('🐴');
//=> 1

stringLength('\u001B[1municorn\u001B[22m');
//=> 7
```

## API
