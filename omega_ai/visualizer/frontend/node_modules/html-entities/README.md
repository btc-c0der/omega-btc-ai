html-entities
=============

Fastest HTML entities library.

Comes with both TypeScript and Flow types.

Installation
------------

```bash
$ npm install html-entities
```

Usage
-----

### encode(text, options)

Encodes text replacing HTML special characters (`<>&"'`) and/or other character ranges depending on `mode` option value.

```js
import {encode} from 'html-entities';

encode('< > " \' & © ∆');
// -> '&lt; &gt; &quot; &apos; &amp; © ∆'

encode('< ©', {mode: 'nonAsciiPrintable'});
// -> '&lt; &copy;'

encode('< ©', {mode: 'nonAsciiPrintable', level: 'xml'});
// -> '&lt; &#169;'

encode('< > " \' & ©', {mode: 'nonAsciiPrintableOnly', level: 'xml'});
// -> '< > " \' & &#169;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.

#### mode

 * `specialChars` encodes only HTML special characters (default).
 * `nonAscii` encodes HTML special characters and everything outside the [ASCII character range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).
 * `nonAsciiPrintable` encodes HTML special characters and everything outiside of the [ASCII printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
 * `nonAsciiPrintableOnly` everything outiside of the [ASCII printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) keeping HTML special characters intact.
 * `extensive` encodes all non-printable characters, non-ASCII characters and all characters with named references.

#### numeric

 * `decimal` uses decimal numbers when encoding html entities. i.e. `&#169;` (default).
 * `hexadecimal` uses hexadecimal numbers when encoding html entities. i.e. `&#xa9;`.


### decode(text, options)

Decodes text replacing entities to characters. Unknown entities are left as is.

```js
import {decode} from 'html-entities';

decode('&lt; &gt; &quot; &apos; &amp; &#169; &#8710;');
// -> '< > " \' & © ∆'

decode('&copy;', {level: 'html5'});
// -> '©'

decode('&copy;', {level: 'xml'});
// -> '&copy;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.

#### scope

 * `body` emulates behavior of browser when parsing tag bodies: entities without semicolon are also replaced (default).
 * `attribute` emulates behavior of browser when parsing tag attributes: entities without semicolon are replaced when not followed by equality sign `=`.
 * `strict` ignores entities without semicolon.

### decodeEntity(text, options)

Decodes a single HTML entity. Unknown entitiy is left as is.

```js
import {decodeEntity} from 'html-entities';

decodeEntity('&lt;');
// -> '<'

decodeEntity('&copy;', {level: 'html5'});
// -> '©'

decodeEntity('&copy;', {level: 'xml'});
// -> '&copy;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.
