Copies non-react specific statics from a child component to a parent component. 
Similar to `Object.assign`, but with React static keywords blacklisted from
being overridden.

```bash
$ npm install --save hoist-non-react-statics
```

## Usage

```js
import hoistNonReactStatics from 'hoist-non-react-statics';

hoistNonReactStatics(targetComponent, sourceComponent);
```

If you have specific statics that you don't want to be hoisted, you can also pass a third parameter to exclude them:

```js
hoistNonReactStatics(targetComponent, sourceComponent, { myStatic: true, myOtherStatic: true });
```

## What does this module do?

See this [explanation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html#static-methods-must-be-copied-over) from the React docs.

## Compatible React Versions

Please use latest 3.x. Versions prior to 3.x will not support ForwardRefs.
