// ESM Exports
// ===========
// This module is the package entry point for ES module users. In other words,
// it is the module they are interfacing with when they import from the whole
// package instead of from a submodule, like this:
//
// ```js
// import { map } from 'underscore';
// ```
//
// The difference with `./index-default`, which is the package entry point for
// CommonJS, AMD and UMD users, is purely technical. In ES modules, named and
// default exports are considered to be siblings, so when you have a default
// export, its properties are not automatically available as named exports. For
// this reason, we re-export the named exports in addition to providing the same
// default export as in `./index-default`.
export { default } from './index-default.js';
export * from './index.js';
