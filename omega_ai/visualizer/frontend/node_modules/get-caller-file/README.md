This is a utility, which allows a function to figure out from which file it was invoked. It does so by inspecting v8's stack trace at the time it is invoked.

Inspired by http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13227489

*note: this relies on Node/V8 specific APIs, as such other runtimes may not work*

## Installation

```bash
yarn add get-caller-file
```

## Usage

Given:

```js
// ./foo.js
const getCallerFile = require('get-caller-file');

module.exports = function() {
  return getCallerFile(); // figures out who called it
};
```

```js
// index.js
const foo = require('./foo');

foo() // => /full/path/to/this/file/index.js
```


## Options:

* `getCallerFile(position = 2)`: where position is stack frame whos fileName we want.
