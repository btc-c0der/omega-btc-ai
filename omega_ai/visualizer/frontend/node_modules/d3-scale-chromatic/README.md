This module provides sequential, diverging and categorical color schemes designed to work with [d3-scale](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale)â€™s scaleOrdinal and scaleSequential. Most of these schemes are derived from Cynthia A. Brewerâ€™s [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org). Since ColorBrewer publishes only discrete color schemes, the sequential and diverging scales are interpolated using [uniform B-splines](https://observablehq.com/@d3/colorbrewer-splines).
