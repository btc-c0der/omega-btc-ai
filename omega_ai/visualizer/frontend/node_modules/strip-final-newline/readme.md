# strip-final-newline [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/strip-final-newline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/sindresorhus/strip-final-newline)

> Strip the final [newline character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) from a string/buffer

Can be useful when parsing the output of, for example, `ChildProcess#execFile`, as [binaries usually output a newline at the end](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/729692/why-should-text-files-end-with-a-newline). Normally, you would use `stdout.trim()`, but that would also remove newlines at the start and whitespace.


## Install

```
$ npm install strip-final-newline
```


## Usage

```js
const stripFinalNewline = require('strip-final-newline');

stripFinalNewline('foo\nbar\n\n');
//=> 'foo\nbar\n'

stripFinalNewline(Buffer.from('foo\nbar\n\n')).toString();
//=> 'foo\nbar\n'
```
