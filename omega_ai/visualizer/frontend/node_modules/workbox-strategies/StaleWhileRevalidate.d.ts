 * request strategy.
 *
 * Resources are requested from both the cache and the network in parallel.
 * The strategy will respond with the cached version if available, otherwise
 * wait for the network response. The cache is updated with the network response
 * with each successful request.
 *
 * By default, this strategy will cache responses with a 200 status code as
 * well as [opaque responses](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/workbox/caching-resources-during-runtime/#opaque-responses).
 * Opaque responses are cross-origin requests where the response doesn't
 * support [CORS](https://enable-cors.org/).
 *
 * If the network request fails, and there is no cache match, this will throw
 * a `WorkboxError` exception.
