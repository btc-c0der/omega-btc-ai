## API

### isPathInside(childPath, parentPath)

Note that relative paths are resolved against `process.cwd()` to make them absolute.

**Important:** This package is meant for use with path manipulation. It does not check if the paths exist nor does it resolve symlinks. You should not use this as a security mechanism to guard against access to certain places on the file system.

#### childPath

Type: `string`

The path that should be inside `parentPath`.

#### parentPath

Type: `string`

The path that should contain `childPath`.
