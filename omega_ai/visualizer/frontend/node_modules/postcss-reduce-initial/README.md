# [postcss][postcss]-reduce-initial

> Reduce `initial` definitions to the _actual_ initial value, where possible.

## Install

With [npm](https://npmjs.org/package/postcss-reduce-initial) do:

```
npm install postcss-reduce-initial --save
```

## Examples

See the [data](data) for more conversions. This data is courtesy
of Mozilla.

### Convert `initial` values

When the `initial` keyword is longer than the property value, it will
be converted:

#### Input

```css
h1 {
  min-width: initial;
}
```

#### Output

```css
h1 {
  min-width: auto;
}
```

### Convert values back to `initial`

When the `initial` value is smaller than the property value, it will
be converted:

#### Input

```css
h1 {
  transform-box: border-box;
}
```

#### Output

```css
h1 {
  transform-box: initial;
}
```

This conversion is only applied when you supply a browsers list that all support
the `initial` keyword; it's worth noting that Internet Explorer has no support.

## API

### reduceInitial([options])

#### options

##### ignore

Type: `Array<String>`
Default: `undefined`

It contains the Array of properties that will be ignored while reducing its value to initial.
Example : `{ ignore : ["min-height"] }`
