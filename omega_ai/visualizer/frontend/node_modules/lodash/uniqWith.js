/**
 * This method is like `_.uniq` except that it accepts `comparator` which

 * @category Array
 * @param {Array} array The array to inspect.
 * @param {Function} [comparator] The comparator invoked per element.
 * @returns {Array} Returns the new duplicate free array.
 * @example
 *
 * var objects = [{ 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }, { 'x': 2, 'y': 1 }, { 'x': 1, 'y': 2 }];
