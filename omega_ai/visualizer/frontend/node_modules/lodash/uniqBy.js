/**
 * This method is like `_.uniq` except that it accepts `iteratee` which is
 * invoked for each element in `array` to generate the criterion by which
 * uniqueness is computed. The order of result values is determined by the
 * order they occur in the array. The iteratee is invoked with one argument:
 * (value).

 * @param {Array} array The array to inspect.
 * @param {Function} [iteratee=_.identity] The iteratee invoked per element.
 * @returns {Array} Returns the new duplicate free array.
 * @example
 *
 * _.uniqBy([2.1, 1.2, 2.3], Math.floor);
 * // => [2.1, 1.2]
