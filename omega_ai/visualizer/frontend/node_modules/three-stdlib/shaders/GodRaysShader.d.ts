/**
 * God-rays (crepuscular rays)
 *
 * Similar implementation to the one used by Crytek for CryEngine 2 [Sousa2008].
 * Blurs a mask generated from the depth map along radial lines emanating from the light
 * source. The blur repeatedly applies a blur filter of increasing support but constant
 * sample count to produce a blur filter with large support.
 *
 * My implementation performs 3 passes, similar to the implementation from Sousa. I found
 * just 6 samples per pass produced acceptible results. The blur is applied three times,
 * with decreasing filter support. The result is equivalent to a single pass with
 * 6*6*6 = 216 samples.
