# string-width

> Get the visual width of a string - the number of columns required to display it

Some Unicode characters are [fullwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms) and use double the normal width. [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code) are stripped and doesn't affect the width.

Useful to be able to measure the actual width of command-line output.

## Install

```
$ npm install string-width
```

## Usage

```js
import stringWidth from 'string-width';

stringWidth('a');
//=> 1

stringWidth('古');
//=> 2

stringWidth('\u001B[1m古\u001B[22m');
//=> 2
```
