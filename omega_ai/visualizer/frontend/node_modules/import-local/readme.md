# import-local

> Let a globally installed package use a locally installed version of itself if available

Useful for CLI tools that want to defer to the user's locally installed version when available, but still work if it's not installed locally. For example, [AVA](https://avajs.dev) and [XO](https://github.com/xojs/xo) uses this method.

## Install

```sh
npm install import-local
```

## Usage

```js
import importLocal from 'import-local';

if (importLocal(import.meta.url)) {
	console.log('Using local version of this package');
} else {
	// Code for both global and local version here…
}
```

You can also pass in `__filename` when used in a CommonJS context.
