description: 'Disallow unnecessary constructors.'
---

> ðŸ›‘ This file is source code, not the primary documentation location! ðŸ›‘
>
> See **https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-useless-constructor** for documentation.

## Examples

This rule extends the base [`eslint/no-useless-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-useless-constructor) rule.
It adds support for:

- constructors marked as `protected` / `private` (i.e. marking a constructor as non-public),
- `public` constructors when there is no superclass,
- constructors with only parameter properties.

### Caveat

This lint rule will report on constructors whose sole purpose is to change visibility of a parent constructor.
See [discussion on this rule's lack of type information](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/3820#issuecomment-917821240) for context.
