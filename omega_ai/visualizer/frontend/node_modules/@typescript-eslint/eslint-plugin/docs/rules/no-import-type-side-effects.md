description: 'Enforce the use of top-level import type qualifier when an import only has specifiers with inline type qualifiers.'

The [`--verbatimModuleSyntax`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#verbatimModuleSyntax) compiler option causes TypeScript to do simple and predictable transpilation on import declarations.
Namely, it completely removes import declarations with a top-level `type` qualifier, and it removes any import specifiers with an inline `type` qualifier.

The latter behavior does have one potentially surprising effect in that in certain cases TS can leave behind a "side effect" import at runtime:

```ts
import { type A, type B } from 'mod';

// is transpiled to

import {} from 'mod';
// which is the same as
import 'mod';
```

For the rare case of needing to import for side effects, this may be desirable - but for most cases you will not want to leave behind an unnecessary side effect import.

## Examples

This rule enforces that you use a top-level `type` qualifier for imports when it only imports specifiers with an inline `type` qualifier

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
import { type A } from 'mod';
import { type A as AA } from 'mod';
import { type A, type B } from 'mod';
import { type A as AA, type B as BB } from 'mod';
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
import type { A } from 'mod';
import type { A as AA } from 'mod';
import type { A, B } from 'mod';
import type { A as AA, B as BB } from 'mod';

import T from 'mod';
import type T from 'mod';

import * as T from 'mod';
import type * as T from 'mod';

import { T } from 'mod';
import type { T } from 'mod';
import { T, U } from 'mod';
import type { T, U } from 'mod';
import { type T, U } from 'mod';
import { T, type U } from 'mod';

import type T, { U } from 'mod';
import T, { type U } from 'mod';
```

## When Not To Use It

- If you want to leave behind side effect imports, then you shouldn't use this rule.
- If you're not using TypeScript 5.0's `verbatimModuleSyntax` option, then you don't need this rule.
