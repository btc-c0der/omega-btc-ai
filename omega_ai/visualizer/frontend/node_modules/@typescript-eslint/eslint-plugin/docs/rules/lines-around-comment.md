It adds support for TypeScript syntax.

See the [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/lines-around-comment) for more details on the `comma-dangle` rule.

## Rule Changes

```jsonc
{
  // note you must disable the base rule as it can report incorrect errors
  "lines-around-comment": "off",
  "@typescript-eslint/lines-around-comment": ["error"]
}
```

- `allowEnumStart: true` doesn't require a blank line before an enum body block start
