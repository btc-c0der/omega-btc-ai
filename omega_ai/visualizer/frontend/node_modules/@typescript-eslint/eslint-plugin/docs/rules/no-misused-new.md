JavaScript classes may define a `constructor` method that runs when a class instance is newly created.
TypeScript allows interfaces that describe a static class object to define a `new()` method (though this is rarely used in real world code).
Developers new to JavaScript classes and/or TypeScript interfaces may sometimes confuse when to use `constructor` or `new`.

This rule reports when a class defines a method named `new` or an interface defines a method named `constructor`.

## Examples

<!--tabs-->

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
declare class C {
  new(): C;
}

interface I {
  new (): I;
  constructor(): void;
}
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
declare class C {
  constructor();
}

interface I {
  new (): C;
}
```

## When Not To Use It

If you intentionally want a class with a `new` method, and you're confident nobody working in your code will mistake it with a constructor.
