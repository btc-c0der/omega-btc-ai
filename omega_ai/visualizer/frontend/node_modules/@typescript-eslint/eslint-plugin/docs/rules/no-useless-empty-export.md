description: "Disallow empty exports that don't change anything in a module file."

An empty `export {}` statement is sometimes useful in TypeScript code to turn a file that would otherwise be a script file into a module file.
Per the [TypeScript Handbook Modules page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html):

> In TypeScript, just as in ECMAScript 2015, any file containing a top-level import or export is considered a module.
> Conversely, a file without any top-level import or export declarations is treated as a script whose contents are available in the global scope (and therefore to modules as well).

However, an `export {}` statement does nothing if there are any other top-level import or export statements in a file.

This rule reports an `export {}` that doesn't do anything in a file already using ES modules.
