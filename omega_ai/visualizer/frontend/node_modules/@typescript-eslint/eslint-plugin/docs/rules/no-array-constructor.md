description: 'Disallow generic `Array` constructors.'

> 🛑 This file is source code, not the primary documentation location! 🛑

> See **https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-array-constructor** for documentation.

## Examples

This rule extends the base [`eslint/no-array-constructor`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-array-constructor) rule.
It adds support for the generically typed `Array` constructor (`new Array<Foo>()`).

<!--tabs-->

### ❌ Incorrect

```ts
/*eslint no-array-constructor: "error"*/

Array(0, 1, 2);
new Array(0, 1, 2);
```

### ✅ Correct

```ts
/*eslint no-array-constructor: "error"*/

Array<number>(0, 1, 2);
new Array<Foo>(x, y, z);

Array(500);
new Array(someOtherArray.length);
```
