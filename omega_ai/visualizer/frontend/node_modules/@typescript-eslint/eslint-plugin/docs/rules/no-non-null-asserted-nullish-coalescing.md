description: 'Disallow non-null assertions in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator.'

The `??` nullish coalescing runtime operator allows providing a default value when dealing with `null` or `undefined`.
Using a `!` non-null assertion type operator in the left operand of a nullish coalescing operator is redundant, and likely a sign of programmer error or confusion over the two operators.

## Examples

### ‚ùå Incorrect

```ts
foo! ?? bar;
foo.bazz! ?? bar;
foo!.bazz! ?? bar;
foo()! ?? bar;

let x!: string;
x! ?? '';

let x: string;
x = foo();
x! ?? '';
```

### ‚úÖ Correct

```ts
foo ?? bar;
foo ?? bar!;
foo!.bazz ?? bar;
foo!.bazz ?? bar!;
foo() ?? bar;

// This is considered correct code because there's no way for the user to satisfy it.
let x: string;
x! ?? '';
```
