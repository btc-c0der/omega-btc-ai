# import/default

üíº This rule is enabled in the following configs: ‚ùó `errors`, ‚òëÔ∏è `recommended`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

If a default import is requested, this rule will report if there is no default
export in the imported module.

For [ES7], reports if a default is named and exported but is not found in the
referenced module.

Note: for packages, the plugin will find exported names
from [`jsnext:main`], if present in `package.json`.
Redux's npm module includes this key, and thereby is lintable, for example.

A module path that is [ignored] or not [unambiguously an ES module] will not be reported when imported.

[ignored]: ../README.md#importignore
[unambiguously an ES module]: https://github.com/bmeck/UnambiguousJavaScriptGrammar

## Rule Details

Given:

```js
// ./foo.js
export default function () { return 42 }

// ./bar.js
export function bar() { return null }

// ./baz.js
module.exports = function () { /* ... */ }

// node_modules/some-module/index.js
exports.sharedFunction = function shared() { /* ... */ }
```

The following is considered valid:

```js
import foo from './foo'

// assuming 'node_modules' are ignored (true by default)
import someModule from 'some-module'
```

...and the following cases are reported:

```js
import bar from './bar' // no default export found in ./bar
import baz from './baz' // no default export found in ./baz
```

## When Not To Use It

If you are using CommonJS and/or modifying the exported namespace of any module at
runtime, you will likely see false positives with this rule.

This rule currently does not interpret `module.exports = ...` as a `default` export,
either, so such a situation will be reported in the importing module.
