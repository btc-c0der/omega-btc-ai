# import/no-internal-modules

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Use this rule to prevent importing the submodules of other modules.

## Rule Details

This rule has two mutally exclusive options that are arrays of [minimatch/glob patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#glob-primer) patterns:

 - `allow` that include paths and import statements that can be imported with reaching.
 - `forbid` that exclude paths and import statements that can be imported with reaching.

### Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
â”œâ”€â”€ actions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getUser.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ updateUser.js
â”œâ”€â”€ reducer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.js
â”œâ”€â”€ redux
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ configureStore.js
â””â”€â”€ app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.js
â””â”€â”€ entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-internal-modules": [ "error", {
      "allow": [ "**/actions/*", "source-map-support/*" ],
    } ]
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import { settings } from './app/index'; // Reaching to "./app/index" is not allowed
import userReducer from './reducer/user'; // Reaching to "./reducer/user" is not allowed
import configureStore from './redux/configureStore'; // Reaching to "./redux/configureStore" is not allowed

export { settings } from './app/index'; // Reaching to "./app/index" is not allowed
export * from './reducer/user'; // Reaching to "./reducer/user" is not allowed
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import 'source-map-support/register';
import { settings } from '../app';
import getUser from '../actions/getUser';

export * from 'source-map-support/register';
export { settings } from '../app';
```

Given the following folder structure:

```pt
my-project
â”œâ”€â”€ actions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ getUser.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ updateUser.js
â”œâ”€â”€ reducer
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.js
â”œâ”€â”€ redux
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ configureStore.js
â””â”€â”€ app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings.js
â””â”€â”€ entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:

```json
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-internal-modules": [ "error", {
      "forbid": [ "**/actions/*", "source-map-support/*" ],
    } ]
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import 'source-map-support/register';
import getUser from '../actions/getUser';

export * from 'source-map-support/register';
export getUser from '../actions/getUser';
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import 'source-map-support';
import { getUser } from '../actions';

export * from 'source-map-support';
export { getUser } from '../actions';
```
