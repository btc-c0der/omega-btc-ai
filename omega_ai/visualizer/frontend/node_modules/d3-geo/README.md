This module uses spherical [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) to represent geographic features in JavaScript. D3 supports a wide variety of common and [unusual](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection) map projections. And because D3 uses spherical geometry to represent data, you can apply any aspect to any projection by rotating geometry.
