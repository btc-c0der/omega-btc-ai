[PostCSS Selector Not] transforms :not() W3C CSS level 4 pseudo classes to :not() CSS level 3 selectors following the [Selectors 4 Specification].

```pcss
p:not(:first-child, .special) {
	color: red;
}

/* becomes */

p:not(:first-child):not(.special) {
	color: red;
}
```

⚠️ Only lists of simple selectors (`:not(.a, .b)`) will work as expected.
Complex selectors (`:not(.a > .b, .c ~ .d)`) can not be downgraded.
