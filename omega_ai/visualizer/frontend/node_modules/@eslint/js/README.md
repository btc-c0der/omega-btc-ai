# ESLint JavaScript Plugin

[Website](https://eslint.org) | [Configure ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure) | [Rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) | [Contributing](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/contribute) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geteslint) | [Chatroom](https://eslint.org/chat)

The beginnings of separating out JavaScript-specific functionality from ESLint.

Right now, this plugin contains two configurations:

* `recommended` - enables the rules recommended by the ESLint team (the replacement for `"eslint:recommended"`)
* `all` - enables all ESLint rules (the replacement for `"eslint:all"`)

## Installation

```shell
npm install @eslint/js -D
```

## Usage

Use in your `eslint.config.js` file anytime you want to extend one of the configs:

```js
import js from "@eslint/js";

export default [

    // apply recommended rules to JS files
    {
        files: ["**/*.js"],
        rules: js.configs.recommended.rules
    },

    // apply recommended rules to JS files with an override
    {
        files: ["**/*.js"],
        rules: {
            ...js.configs.recommended.rules,
            "no-unused-vars": "warn"
        } 
    },

    // apply all rules to JS files
    {
        files: ["**/*.js"],
        rules: {
            ...js.configs.all.rules,
            "no-unused-vars": "warn"
        } 
    }
]
```
