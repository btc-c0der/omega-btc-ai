***Node-core string_decoder for userland***

This package is a mirror of the string_decoder implementation in Node-core.

Full documentation may be found on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/dist/v8.9.4/docs/api/).

As of version 1.0.0 **string_decoder** uses semantic versioning.

## Previous versions

Previous version numbers match the versions found in Node core, e.g. 0.10.24 matches Node 0.10.24, likewise 0.11.10 matches Node 0.11.10.

## Update

The *build/* directory contains a build script that will scrape the source from the [nodejs/node](https://github.com/nodejs/node) repo given a specific Node version.

## Streams Working Group

`string_decoder` is maintained by the Streams Working Group, which
oversees the development and maintenance of the Streams API within
Node.js. The responsibilities of the Streams Working Group include:

* Addressing stream issues on the Node.js issue tracker.
* Authoring and editing stream documentation within the Node.js project.
* Reviewing changes to stream subclasses within the Node.js project.
* Redirecting changes to streams from the Node.js project to this
  project.
* Assisting in the implementation of stream providers within Node.js.
* Recommending versions of `readable-stream` to be included in Node.js.
* Messaging about the future of streams to give the community advance
  notice of changes.

See [readable-stream](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream) for
more details.
