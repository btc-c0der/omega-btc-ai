randombytes from node that works in the browser.  In node you just get crypto.randomBytes, but in the browser it uses .crypto/msCrypto.getRandomValues

```js
var randomBytes = require('randombytes');
randomBytes(16);//get 16 random bytes
randomBytes(16, function (err, resp) {
  // resp is 16 random bytes
});
```
