This plugin transform this css:

```css
.foo {
  width: clamp(10px, 4em, 80px);
}
```

into this:

```css
.foo {
  width: max(10px, min(4em, 80px));
}
```

Or with enabled options `precalculate`:

```css
.foo {
  width: clamp(10em, 4px, 10px);
}

/* becomes */

.foo {
  width: max(10em, 14px);
}
```

## Options

### precalculate

The `precalculate` option determines whether values with the same unit
should be precalculated. By default, these are not precalculation.

```js
postcssColorHexAlpha({
  precalculate: true
});
```

The second and third value has the same unit (`px`):

```css
.foo {
  width: clamp(10em, 4px, 10px);
}

/* becomes */

.foo {
  width: max(10em, 14px);
}
```

Here all values have the same unit:

```css
.foo {
  width: clamp(10px, 4px, 10px);
}

/* becomes */

.foo {
  width: 24px;
}
```
