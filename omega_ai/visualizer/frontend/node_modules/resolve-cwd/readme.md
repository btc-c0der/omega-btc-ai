# resolve-cwd [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-cwd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-cwd)

> Resolve the path of a module like [`require.resolve()`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve) but from the current working directory


## Install

```
$ npm install resolve-cwd
```


## Usage

```js
const resolveCwd = require('resolve-cwd');

console.log(__dirname);
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/rainbow'

console.log(process.cwd());
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn'

console.log(resolveCwd('./foo'));
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/unicorn/foo.js'
```


## API

### resolveCwd(moduleId)

Like `require()`, throws when the module can't be found.

### resolveCwd.silent(moduleId)

Returns `undefined` instead of throwing when the module can't be found.

#### moduleId

Type: `string`

What you would use in `require()`.
