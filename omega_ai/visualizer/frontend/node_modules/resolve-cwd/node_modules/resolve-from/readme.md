# resolve-from [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-from.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/resolve-from)

> Resolve the path of a module like [`require.resolve()`](https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require_resolve) but from a given path


## Install

```
$ npm install resolve-from
```


## Usage

```js
const resolveFrom = require('resolve-from');

// There is a file at `./foo/bar.js`

resolveFrom('foo', './bar');
//=> '/Users/sindresorhus/dev/test/foo/bar.js'
```


## API

### resolveFrom(fromDirectory, moduleId)

Like `require()`, throws when the module can't be found.

### resolveFrom.silent(fromDirectory, moduleId)

Returns `undefined` instead of throwing when the module can't be found.

#### fromDirectory

Type: `string`

Directory to resolve from.

#### moduleId

Type: `string`

What you would use in `require()`.


## Tip

Create a partial using a bound function if you want to resolve from the same `fromDirectory` multiple times:

```js
const resolveFromFoo = resolveFrom.bind(null, 'foo');

resolveFromFoo('./bar');
resolveFromFoo('./baz');
```
