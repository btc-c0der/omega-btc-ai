# Omega-BTC-AI Recommendation System

The recommendation system provides divine guidance for trading actions based on metaphysical principles, sacred geometry, and cosmic mathematics.

## Core Components

### Position Harmony Advisor

The `PositionHarmonyAdvisor` provides divine guidance for position sizing and management based on Golden Ratio principles and Fibonacci sequence harmony.

#### Key Features

- **Phi-Based Position Sizing**: Recommends position sizes that align with the Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618...) and Fibonacci proportions.
- **Long/Short Balance**: Ensures your portfolio maintains balance between long and short positions according to cosmic principles.
- **Harmony Scoring**: Evaluates the overall harmony of your positions with a multi-factor scoring system.
- **Divine Advice**: Provides cosmic guidance tailored to your portfolio's alignment with universal mathematics.
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks the harmony of your positions over time to identify improving or degrading cosmic alignment.

#### Usage Example

```python
from omega_ai.recommendations.position_harmony import PositionHarmonyAdvisor

# Initialize the advisor
advisor = PositionHarmonyAdvisor(
    max_account_risk=0.0618,  # 6.18% max account risk (φ-based)
    position_phi_targets=True,
    long_short_balance=True
)

# Get divine guidance for your positions
analysis = advisor.analyze_positions(
    positions=current_positions,  # List of position dictionaries
    account_balance=account_value,
    leverage=account_leverage
)

# Access divine advice
print(analysis['harmony_score'])  # 0.0-1.0 harmony score
print(analysis['harmony_state'])  # e.g., "DIVINE_HARMONY", "PHI_RESONANCE", etc.
print(analysis['divine_advice'])  # Cosmic guidance message

# Follow recommendations for achieving harmony
for rec in analysis['recommendations']:
    print(rec['description'])  # e.g., "Long/short ratio exceeds φ; reduce long exposure..."
```

#### Mathematics of Harmony

The Position Harmony Advisor uses sacred mathematical principles including:

- **Golden Ratio (φ)**: 1.618034...
- **Inverse Golden Ratio (1/φ)**: 0.618034...
- **Fibonacci Position Sizing**: Using levels derived from the Fibonacci sequence
- **Phi Resonance**: Measuring how closely position relationships match the divine proportion

#### Position Sizing Recommendations

The advisor recommends these φ-based position sizes (as percentage of account):

- 0.618% - Micro position (φ⁻²)
- 1% - Mini position
- 1.618% - Minimal risk (φ⁻¹)
- 2.618% - Low risk (φ)
- 3.82% - Moderate risk (38.2% retracement)
- 6.18% - Standard risk (61.8% retracement)
- 10% - Higher risk
- 16.18% - Maximum risk (φ × 10%)

## Additional Modules
