## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/btc-c0der/omega-btc-ai.git
   cd omega-btc-ai
   ```

2. Open the Divine Book Browser:

   ```bash
   # On macOS/Linux
   open divine_book_browser/index.html
   
   # On Windows
   start divine_book_browser/index.html
   ```

3. Alternatively, use a local server for better experience:

   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server
   
   # Then navigate to
   # http://localhost:8000/divine_book_browser/
   ```

4. Using the Divine Book Browser Server:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the divine_book_browser directory
   cd divine_book_browser
   
   # Make the installation script executable
   chmod +x install_service.sh
   
   # Run the installation script
   ./install_service.sh
   
   # The server will now run on port 8888
   # Access the Divine Book Browser at:
   # http://localhost:8888
   ```

   The installation script will:
   - Set up a macOS service that starts automatically when you log in
   - Run the server on port 8888 (or next available port if 8888 is in use)
   - Make the Divine Book Browser accessible at <http://localhost:8888>
   - Automatically redirect the root URL (/) to index.html

   You can also use the included `run_server.sh` script to manually start the server for testing:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the divine_book_browser directory
   cd divine_book_browser
   
   # Make the run script executable
   chmod +x run_server.sh
   
   # Run the server directly
   ./run_server.sh
   ```
